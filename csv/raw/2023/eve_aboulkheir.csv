For our money it's his most satisfying full-length to date, an earworm-addled/emo pop record that's as strange, poignant and haunted as his breakout 'Diversions 1994-1996'.

It's a devilishly specific sound, recalling bits of Basinski and FUJI||||||||||TA, but steeped in GRM lore gliding into liminal states where things are never quite what they seem.

With a title like ‘Shifted in Dreams’, you might expect Bonnet to grip onto a shoegaze-ambient third rail and shock himself into latter-day... more",/products/shifted-in-dreams,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/854217/product/SP144_Cover.jpg,2242,Eve Aboulkheir,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2242
