""Like a dream foggily remembered, Loopsel’s Öga for Öga is tempting in its beauty yet slightly menacing in its depth. These songs, like paths in the forest forest, are heavily, almost treacherously, reverberated, with finger-plucked guitars acting as your signposts amongst the flora and fauna of field recordings, pads, and the cool, calm voice of Elin Engström.

Fractal jazz, sandblasted rap, brittle concrète soundscapes and ghosted, melancholy ambience - all of it vaporised into a charged sermon filled with hidden messages and spiritual weight.
