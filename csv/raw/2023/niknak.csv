Featuring guest appearances from Marina Herlop, keiyaA, Corey Mastrangelo, Eden Samara, George Riley and Contour.

The first taste we had of 'Gentle Confrontation' was '2003', the album's most personal track - a sombre, beatless memorial that drapes James' newly confident vocals over a bed of dreamy oohs and ahhs.

It's on 'Missed Call' that ""Raven"" begins to fully unravel. A very different album from its predecessor (2017's universally acclaimed ""Take Me Apart"") it hums like sulfur after a firework display - pink and green and blue becomes grey and yellow.

In just a few short years, Kenyan sound artist KMRU has built up a startling canon of drone-heavy musical experiments, ranging from the pensive, Editions Mego-released 'Peel' to the cripplingly heavy Aho Ssan collaboration 'Limen'... more",/products/dissolution-grip,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/895452/product/880918263199.jpg,2297,NikNak,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2297

Berlin-based Kenyan sound artist KMRU let his heart sing a little louder on 'Drawing Water', one of the most unbound, melodic releases he's put into the world.
