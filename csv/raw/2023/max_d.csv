              (Kranky)",Kranky,"‘Exit Simulation’ is the startling debut from South Carolina's Heather Sinclair aka Niecy Blues, who makes a dramatic entrance using the language of ambient, trip-hop and dream pop to ink her own signature on gospel, R&B and melancholy soul. One of the most convincing debut albums in recent memory, consider it essential listening if you're into KeiyaA, Grouper, Erykah Badu, Dawuna, or Kelela.

Sinclair spent her childhood in the confines of a religious cult in Oklahoma, and on 'Exit... more",/products/exit-simulation,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916478/product/Niecy-Blues_Tip23.jpg,2264,Max D,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2264

Roiling in the wake of his Cav Empt tape, PLO Man’s ‘anonymousmaterial’ prizes the whole “faceless techno” era of ‘90s dance music when a cohort of lowkey artists laid the bed for for today’s LARPers. On each count PLO Man coaxes pulsating rhythms and chattering synths with restless, hands-on discipline that we imagine will beautifully... more",/products/anonymousmaterial,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/894544/product/plo-man-flat.jpg,2264,Max D,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2264

Quite simply ‘World of Echo’ is among the most important, groundbreaking avant-pop records of the late c.20th, so the release of ‘Picture of Bunny Rabbit’ after 38 years in the archive is nothing short of momentous. Sourced from a fiercely guarded... more",/products/picture-of-bunny-rabbit,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916405/product/arthur_russell_Tip23.jpg,2264,Max D,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2264
