              (Nyege Nyege Tapes)",Nyege Nyege Tapes,"A deafening collision of squealing, carnivalesque electronics, wrecked baile funk and psychedelic vocals, DJ K's unhinged debut album is an important document of São Paulo's burgeoning Bruxaria sound.

If you've spent any time swiping thru TikTok then you've likely heard the distorted brand of baile funk that's characterised by a clash of sirens, jackhammer beats, long delays and garbled, overlayed Brazilian voices. That's Bruxaria, a sound that emerged from Baile do Helipa, a street party... more",/products/panico-no-submundo,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/882690/product/768558901339.jpg,2210,Anthony Naples,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2210

Every track is rolled out in regular, fast, or slurred versions, slanted and enchanted to enhance a sense of sensual, blunted delirium that comes highly recommended if yr into Future, Young Thug, Lee Gamble’s new one, Lil B, Iceboy Violet, DJ Screw.

Orcutt might be best known for his freeform attack on blues, but his technique is equally as enthralling when mapped to rootsy American folk. 'Jump On It' is a relatively restrained set from the ex-Harry Pussy shredder, and benefits from its resistance to... more",/products/jump-on-it,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/858432/product/A10369V00000010582_T95226779150054.jpg,2210,Anthony Naples,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2210
