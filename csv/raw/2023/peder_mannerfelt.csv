              (Palilalia)",Palilalia,"Utterly beguiling solo acoustic material from Bill Orcutt, a follow-up of sorts to 2013's 'A History of Every One'. If you wanna hear what Orcutt sounds like when he's breathing in the influence of Jack Rose and Erik Satie, this one's for you.

Orcutt might be best known for his freeform attack on blues, but his technique is equally as enthralling when mapped to rootsy American folk. 'Jump On It' is a relatively restrained set from the ex-Harry Pussy shredder, and benefits from its resistance to... more",/products/jump-on-it,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/858432/product/A10369V00000010582_T95226779150054.jpg,2271,Peder Mannerfelt,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2271

Gordon Bruce aka Brunnera hails from Glasgow and makes the sort of nutty dance music that could only come from our deeply fucking weird islands.

‘Beautiful Age’ is SSIEGE’s reflection on adolescence and the gauzy fidelity of memory, using an electro-acoustic array of piano, samples, tape loops, synths and field recordings to evoke feelings of longing for the eternal spring of youth.
