              (Kranky)",Kranky,"‘Exit Simulation’ is the startling debut from South Carolina's Heather Sinclair aka Niecy Blues, who makes a dramatic entrance using the language of ambient, trip-hop and dream pop to ink her own signature on gospel, R&B and melancholy soul. One of the most convincing debut albums in recent memory, consider it essential listening if you're into KeiyaA, Grouper, Erykah Badu, Dawuna, or Kelela.

Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. It’s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if you’re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2347,Jay Glass Dubs,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2347
