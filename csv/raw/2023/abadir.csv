Stronger and more intentionally mannered than its predecessor 'Pripyat', 'Nekkuja' is a leap forward for Herlop, who wrote the album as she pondered her creative future in her Spanish apartment. She wanted to grasp pop more wholeheartedly, and ignore the pull of darkness that seemed to have a hold on her... more",/products/nekkuja,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/901693/product/617308061666.jpg,2392,ABADIR,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2392

He's back.

We're not gonna lie, 'Magic Oneohtrix Point Never' didn't quite work for us.

‘Revanchist’ is an 8-track album said to “explore the latent potential in Trance to evoke, beyond Euphoria, the fullest feeling of the Sublime.” Wethinks there’s a tongue-in-cheek in that mission statement’s evocation of religiosity, but also they’re deadly fucking serious.
