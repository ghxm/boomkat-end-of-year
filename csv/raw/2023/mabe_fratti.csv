              Again
            
              (Warp Records)",Warp Records,"Daniel Lopatin reclaims the uncanny sorcery of 'Garden of Delete' on 'Again', evanescing divergent styles into an unashamedly pompous roil of vapor-damaged harpsichord twangs, bombastic synth-prog workouts, damaged emo-pop, computer-controlled avant minimalism and fractal ambience. He's back.

We're not gonna lie, 'Magic Oneohtrix Point Never' didn't quite work for us. The album might have been a way for Lopatin to hearken back to his musical roots as his star rapidly... more",/products/again-69fd4604-948c-4d1c-9243-b4e434b07e51,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/909516/product/5056614708103_T14_Image.jpg,2239,Mabe Fratti,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2239

              (15 love)",15 love,"Danish producer ML Buch studies the fertile space between vintage songcraft and contemporary synthetics on 'Suntub', smudging MIDI guitar riffs and soft rock pads into acoustic instrumentation and soaring earworms. It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.

Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. It’s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if you’re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2239,Mabe Fratti,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2239
