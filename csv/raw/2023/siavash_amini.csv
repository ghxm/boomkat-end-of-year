Lamb is a noted composer and has collaborated with Eliane Radigue, Julia Holter and Phill Niblock among many others. ’parallaxis forma’ is Lamb’s first solo release since 2021’s ‘Muto Infinitas’ for Another Timbre, and features three works performed by Explore Ensemble and Exaudi Music Ensemble, under the direction of Nicolas Moroz and... more",/products/parallaxis-forma,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/902964/product/0033339068_10.jpg,2316,Siavash Amini,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2316

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else.
