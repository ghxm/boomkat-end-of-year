Carrier is the new alias of Guy Brewer, whose bleak techno as Shifted, and grittier noise functions as Covered in Sand, have been keenly in step with experimental club mutations over the past decade. His new EP ‘Neither Curve Nor Edge’ builds on a preliminary TTT session in ’23 with a more deliberate... more",/products/neither-curve-nor-edge,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/907833/product/8718723234009.jpg,2222,Call Super,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2222

Essential listening if yr into Voice Actor, Third Eye Foundation, Luboš Fišer, Islaja or Oï les Ox.

If there's one thing that drew us to their last album 'azurescens' it was the album's effortless grasp of psychedelia - not a single particular aesthetic or another, but the... more",/products/le-roi-est-l-oiseau,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/908740/product/FC06.jpg,2222,Call Super,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2222
