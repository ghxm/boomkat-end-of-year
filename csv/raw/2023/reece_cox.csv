Huge recommendation for followers/lovers of Kara-Lis Coverdale, Ryan Trecartin or Mica Levi’s ‘Zola’ score

Leading on from his ’Remain Calm’ album to accompany visual components by... more",/products/immunotherapy,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/846839/product/11Distro_Preview_RAVE041.jpg,2408,Reece Cox,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2408

              (Recital)",Recital,"'Sending Up A Spiral Of' is US sound artist Sydney Spann's first vinyl release, and works as a neatly-presented introduction to their idiosyncratic catalog. Using environmental recordings, vocals, sine tones and rough, tactile sounds, Spann brings attention to the language and love of care workers, working obscure lullabies into her peculiar compositions.

Only a few seconds into the 20-minute title track of 'Sending Up A Spiral Of', it's pretty clear we're in for something special.

Constructed out of 426 tape loops of Enya’s 1988 album 'Watermark' it’s an obvious companion to Romance’s Celine Dion sampling ‘Once Upon A Time’, hitting a similar intersection of blissed out smudge and genuine love for the source material.
