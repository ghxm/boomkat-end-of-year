In many respects it's an album no-less influential than ""Laughing Stock"", once again extending the parameters and smudging the boundaries between many disparate musical styles and influences, taking elements of jazz, classical and devotional music without ever really... more",/products/mark-hollis-2011-edition,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/633494/product/Mark-Hollis-self-titled-album-cover-820.jpg,2358,Fergus Jones,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2358

vibrant Bristol post-rock scene that included artists like Flying Saucer
Attack, Movietone, and Third Eye Foundation. The Crescent line-up
includes members of both Movietone and Flying Saucer Attack. This is
their fourth album, and most accessible to date. The occasional raw,
explosive violence of previous recordings is replaced with a collection
of songs that unfurl slowly and recall points from John Fahey to The

A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.

Orcutt might be best known for his freeform attack on blues, but his technique is equally as enthralling when mapped to rootsy American folk.
