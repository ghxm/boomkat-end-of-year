              (SVBKVLT)",SVBKVLT,"ABADIR returns with a new album for SVBKVLT,  inspired by the choral music he heard as a child growing up in Heliopolis, Cairo, where he attended church for Sunday mass and on Christian holidays. A rich sonic tapestry of tangled memories, ‘Ison’ is aided by modernist electronic gestures that veer from ghosted liturgical vignettes to melodic, rhythmic and padded IDM variants, tipped if yr into anything from Lee Gamble to Art of Noise, Gabber Modus Operandi to Manuel Göttsching.

              (Dead Oceans)",Dead Oceans,"Slowdive's fifth album and second since reforming is an impeccably-produced delight that captures the blown-out beauty of their beloved 'Souvlaki', bringing it into new territory with fractal, psychedelic textures and stacked analog synth cycles.

It's so rare for cherished, trailblazing bands to reform and retain their OG energy that it's almost easier to believe it never happens. Slowdive have always had knack for sidestepping expectations though; even when they were releasing their most... more",/products/everything-is-alive,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/898395/product/656605153261.jpg,2393,8ULENTINA,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2393

A firework display for anyone into Siouxsie and the Banshees, Drexciya, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Kathy Acker or Lizzy Mercier Descloux.

It would have been far too obvious for Huxtable to emerge with a project that simply built on her reputation as a DJ.

Philly's DJ Haram instinctively impresses with her new double A-side, feeding weighty subject matter into her intricately layered, club-ready productions.
