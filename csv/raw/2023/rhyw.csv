              (Border Community)",Border Community,"Holden outdoes himself on this latest psychedelic voyage, combining his latter-day kosmische flirtations with his breakout shoegaze-trance experiments. At its best, it sounds like Cluster doing 808 State, or Göttsching doing Shpongle. 

James Holden has had a wild ride of it. As a teen he was fascinated by the pirate radio stations he'd just about be able to tune into from his dull West Midlands village, and before he'd hit 20 he was already producing major label dance music and touring... more",/products/imagine-this-is-a-high-dimensional-space-of-all-possibilities,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/861899/product/5051083186025.jpg,2425,Rhyw,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2425

The keenly awaited ‘With a Hammer’ catches Kathy Yaeji Lee in uniquely agile form mutating her special blend of tropes from the house spectrum with memory updates of D&B, K-Pop, skudged downbeats and ‘90s grunge for a sweetly satisfying... more",/products/with-a-hammer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/868691/product/191404900956_T14_Image.jpg,2425,Rhyw,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2425

The first new Karenn sesh since 2020’s ‘Music Sounds Better With Shoe’ lands with the dance packed again, delivering four propulsive screwballs marked by weirdo production tics and vocals.

‘Feeling Horizontal’ boots it off like Yello’s Carlos Peron jamming with Green Velvet, and ‘Happy Birthday’ tilts Chicago butterfly rhythms thru a gauntlet of trippy modular filters. ‘From Hunk to Husk’ is one of the titles of the year and sounds... more",/products/everything-is-curly,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/878220/product/8718723229388.jpg,2425,Rhyw,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2425

There's something unexpected happening in Berlin at the moment. Bored with the monotony of minimal techno, plenty of the local scene's sharpest minds have helped shift the focus from booming, Berghain-appropriate kick drum worship towards a woozier, bassier sound that's heating up parties no longer relegated to the fringes.

Responsible for spreading a dancefloor heatwave with his programming of Insurgentes and its TraTraTrax offshoot (Nick León, DJ BabaTr, Tomás Urquieta et al), Verraco simmers his sound to a UK/EU friendly form of tech electronica with subtle trance appeal, sort like Arca gone 4/4, and necessarily kinked with Latin suss.

‘Lost and Happy’ is Ritz’s 3rd 12” since pushing off at blistering pace with ‘trope Insurance’ for Seat Equity in 2019. The four new tracks mark a subtle but crucial development and refinement of his style, slightly reducing the pace and honing his leads to an affective nose-drip tang over classic trance bassline in ‘feel the rain’, and slipping into kinkier mode on the cantering groove and chromatic twirl of ‘firefly’... more",/products/lost-and-happy,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/894536/product/benritz-flat.jpg,2425,Rhyw,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2425
