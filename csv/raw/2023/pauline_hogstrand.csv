              (Audika Records)",Audika Records,"Perhaps one of the least well-known, yet most sought-after Arthur Russell recordings, the orchestral Tower of Meaning (1981), conducted by Julius Eastman, was effectively the first long player to bear Arthur’s name at the top. Beyond the original edition of 320 copies and an inclusion on the First Thought Best Thought reissue in 2006, it has been out of print ever since, so this new Audika issue is pretty much essential.

The transcendent, fleeting original was written for, yet rejected by... more",/products/tower-of-meaning,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/334668/product/arthurtower.jpeg,2320,Pauline Hogstrand,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2320

              (Subtext Recordings)",Subtext Recordings,"Ellen Arkbro uses a rare renaissance organ to emulate a sort of slow, gauzy blues music in the gently compelling organ and brass of her debut album. Arguably one of the most striking, drone records of recent years, ‘For Organ and Brass’ is a must listen for brass obsessives, featuring Elena Kakaliagou on horn, Hilary Jeffery on Trombone and Robin Hayward on microtonal Tuba, following the aesthetic parameters of Arkbro’s exalted Just Intonation tutors, La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela and Jung... more",/products/for-organ-and-brass,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/473880/product/5065002106292_T33037138890054.jpg,2320,Pauline Hogstrand,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2320

Gorgeous, heartmelting gear for fans of Sofie Birch, Alice Coltrane, Laraaji and Jim O'Rourke.

First released in 1994, a couple of years after Selected Ambient Works 85-92, the follow-up largely does away with beats in favour of properly K’d out atmospheres and meandering melodies that lull us into thee lushest and strangest headspace.

It's a stunning realisation of ideas borne out of academic and conceptual rigour, with a perception-altering quality that encourages exploration without a preordained endpoint.

The Sacrificial Code’ takes a more surgical approach to the methods first explored on last year’s ‘Organ Dirges 2016 - 2017’.
