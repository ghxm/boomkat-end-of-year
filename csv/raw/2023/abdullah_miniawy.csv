It's brain-warping, queered avant-pop that bends in on itself like a möbius strip to sound something like Tom Waits, Toshinori Kondo and The Knife on a demented 3way.

The first taste we had of 'Gentle Confrontation' was '2003', the album's most personal track - a sombre, beatless memorial that drapes James' newly confident vocals over a bed of dreamy oohs and ahhs.
