Back in 2020, Muir put together a 90-minute mix for Honey Soundsystem, blending tracks from Kelman Duran, DJ Olive, Daniel Lanois and Terre Thaemlitz with obliquely camp dialog samples from... more",/products/bathhouse-blues,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/901189/product/cover.jpg,2375,Pent,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2375

Asking what happens when we dream, Liyou softens the fantasy with soaring vocals, scintillating jazzy piano phrases and subtly industrial textures, channeling Julee Cruise, claire rousay and Robert Ashley all at once.

Artistry can be a little like magic when aesthetic concerns are put to one side and personal perspective takes over.

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else. Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, featuring contributions from Bendik Giske, James Underwood, Lucy Railton and Coby Sey... more",/products/atlas-9a4f61b4-d3d4-4c49-8085-6e9cea1b61a6,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916443/product/Laurel_AOTY.jpg,2375,Pent,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2375

Using environmental recordings, vocals, sine tones and rough, tactile sounds, Spann brings attention to the language and love of care workers, working obscure lullabies into her peculiar compositions.

Only a few seconds into the 20-minute title track of 'Sending Up A Spiral Of', it's pretty clear we're in for something special.
