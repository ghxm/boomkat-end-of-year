              (Melody As Truth)",Melody As Truth,"Jonny Nash presents his sixth solo album, a ""personal folk"" album that blurs discernible songs into ghostly, dream pop memories, coming across like Durutti Column, Brian Eno or Grouper.

We reckon ambient folk has to be a genre by now, right? Nash's 'Point of Entry' is certainly a solid representation of the genre, drawing from his work with Gigi Masin and Young Marco as Gaussian Curve just as much as it does his recent run of trad folk-inspired plates. Nash's gentle fingerpicking sits at the... more",/products/point-of-entry-24485c5f-e6d4-4551-b43d-95149057d3c0,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/886892/product/A10341T000006REYKS_T98249430170054.jpg,2452,Matt McDermott,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2452

              (Recital)",Recital,"'Sending Up A Spiral Of' is US sound artist Sydney Spann's first vinyl release, and works as a neatly-presented introduction to their idiosyncratic catalog. Using environmental recordings, vocals, sine tones and rough, tactile sounds, Spann brings attention to the language and love of care workers, working obscure lullabies into her peculiar compositions.

Only a few seconds into the 20-minute title track of 'Sending Up A Spiral Of', it's pretty clear we're in for something special.

One for fans of Stroom, Broadcast, Romance, Akira Rabelais, GAS.

We described Schoppik's self-titled Läuten Der Seele debut as a sort of Bavarian answer to hauntology, with its fantastical patchwork of Deutsche cultural artifacts and disintegrated cinematic swoops.
