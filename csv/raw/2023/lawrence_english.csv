              (Ergot Records)",Ergot Records,"Deeply moving, previously unreleased material from the late electronic composer and flautist Ruth Anderson and sound artist Annea Lockwood, who separately capture their five-decade creative and romantic connection on this collection of previously unheard archival recordings, featuring snippets of phone conversations between the pair, field recordings, slowed and treated songs of the era and meditative concréte. Stunning material, pretty much impossible not to well up listening to it.

After leaving his mark everywhere from Kranky to Entr’acte and Idle Hands over the decades, Strategy’s umpteenth album sprays six permutations of cruddy dub electronics smeared with FX in a style and pattern that’s served him well.

Rendered thru simmering jazz keys, microtonal drone, double bass, piano and skittering percussion, it’s just completely unmissable gear that comes highly recommended to anyone with a Jim obsession, or for those of you who love those Tindersticks scores for... more",/products/hands-that-bind-original-motion-picture-soundtrack,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/872862/product/781484083924.jpg,2424,Lawrence English,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2424
