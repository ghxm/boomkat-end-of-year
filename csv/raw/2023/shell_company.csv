Chasing up predominantly drill/grime drops by Nammy Wams, Kid D, Majima and A.G. on AP Life, the four avant-pop songs on ’Snakeskin’ lend an attractive new sidespin to the label’s agenda.

Fractal jazz, sandblasted rap, brittle concrète soundscapes and ghosted, melancholy ambience - all of it vaporised into a charged sermon filled with hidden messages and spiritual weight.
