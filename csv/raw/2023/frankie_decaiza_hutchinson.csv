‘Homesick’ was forged in the wake of the C19 lockdown, when the artist hit a creative streak during days at her studio desk. The downtime afforded by the pandemic prompted Ciel to firm up her production ideas with strong influence from her research of traditional Chinese instrumentation which lends a spirit to the bare boned functionality of her rhythm tracks.
