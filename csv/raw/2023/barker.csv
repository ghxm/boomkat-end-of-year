The ‘Verve EP’ gives a strong flavour of JakoJako’s taste for modular and analog synthesis across four club tools that oscillate straight-laced and offbeat arrangements. ‘Impetus’ is built to hold a sublime tension at peak times with its galloping kicks and ascendent choral pads precipitating a soaring trance arp around the half way... more",/products/verve-ep,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/853299/product/5400863089573.jpg,2270,Barker,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2270

‘绿帽 Green Hat’ is the 2nd album of strapping club music and computer game-like SFX by Malay born, Taiwan-based artist Tzusing.
