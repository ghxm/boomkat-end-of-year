              (Domino Recording Co)",Domino Recording Co,"Perfection from Tirzah once again with perhaps her most loosely structured and hard hitting album to date, as usual produced by Mica Levi, whose chaotic but deeply schooled energy elevates the material here to genuinely all-timer status, using weirdo reverb and doubled up vocal phasing to turn simple hooks into screwed and unforgettable earworms, surrounded by compressed, almost clipped rhythms (the same beat on every track ðŸ¤¯) stretched over lilting piano motifs thatâ€™ll have u... more",/products/trip9love,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916504/product/887828051465_T12_Image_Tip23.jpg,2411,Nic Tasker,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2411

              (15 love)",15 love,"Danish producer ML Buch studies the fertile space between vintage songcraft and contemporary synthetics on 'Suntub', smudging MIDI guitar riffs and soft rock pads into acoustic instrumentation and soaring earworms. It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.

â€˜Vidreoâ€™ is among the most satisfying debuts weâ€™ve heard in 2023. Its eight songs are surely defined by the ethereal tenor of Mabe Frattiâ€™s vocals, as beloved from last year's fantastic 'Se Ve Desde AquÃ­' album for Unheard Of Hope, but here wrapped... more",/products/vidrio,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/917389/product/7.jpg,2411,Nic Tasker,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2411

Yo La Tengo are unassumingly good, but ""This Stupid World"" is better than that - it's almost casually brilliant, but there's a level of drive and effortless skill that carries the album into another dimension.
