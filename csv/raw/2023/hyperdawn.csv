Taking inspiration from Wendy Carlos and the seemingly endless pain of heartbreak, he tangles prog with jazz, dub reggae, hip-hop, neo-classical experimentation, ambient music and indie pop.

Featuring Voice Actor, Mica Levi, Iceboy Violet, Coby Sey, Richie Culver, RenzNiro and bobbieorkid.

Initially billed as a set of demos and ideas, 'flashes in time' sounds significantly more substantial now with a couple of years to marinate than it did when it initially emerged in the throes of COVID-19.
