              (Warm Winters Ltd.)",Warm Winters Ltd.,"Michigan's Infant inks an audio diary on 'sigla, sone', using his manipulated voice to haunt digitally corrupted recordings of crashing waves, nesting birds and snatched conversations.

There's a sensitive, personal quality to 'sigla, sone' that doesn't just emerge from Infant's use of archival environmental recordings. Sure, those snapshots help situate us in his lived reality, but it's Infant's use of the voice that provides the album with its beating heart. It's subtle at first: on opening track 'Part and... more",/products/sigla-sone,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/908513/product/5050580815964.jpg,2378,Adela Mede,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2378

              (Warm Winters Ltd.)",Warm Winters Ltd.,"Microtonal zither twangs, off-world vocals and k-hole sonic wonders characterise Martyna Basta's brilliant second album, a crepuscular muddle of improvisations and granular invocations.

Martyna Basta's 'Making Eye Contact With Solitude' took us by surprise, demolishing the borders between electro-acoustic experimentation, wyrd folk and ambient music by infusing scholarly expertise with raw, unbounded passion. Its followup pushes even deeper into the unknown, crumpling real-world... more",/products/slowly-forgetting-barely-remembering,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916381/product/5050580799516_Tip23.jpg,2378,Adela Mede,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2378

              (Warm Winters Ltd.)",Warm Winters Ltd.,"Slovak dreamweaver Richard Hronsky creates weightless soundscapes on his second full-length, tangling processed environmental recordings with stuttering synth loops, baroque snippets, frozen drones and searing, saturated noise.

There's a strong sense of chronology to 'CLOSURES'. Hronsky is light on exact detail - the press release alludes to a painful loss - but listening to the album from beginning to end feels like hearing a drama unfold in real time.

'Symposium Musicum' is an almost inscrutable proposition: conceptually dense and sonically jagged material that not only requires attention but multiple listens to unspool its tangled mass of ideas and themes.
