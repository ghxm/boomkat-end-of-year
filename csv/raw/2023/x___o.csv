              (Warp Records)",Warp Records,"Silken and surprisingly sunny, Kelela's long-awaited third full-length distills her ineffable essence into poetic, horizontal lyricism over murmured afterparty bumps and gaseous post-club ambience. 

It's on 'Missed Call' that ""Raven"" begins to fully unravel. A very different album from its predecessor (2017's universally acclaimed ""Take Me Apart"") it hums like sulfur after a firework display - pink and green and blue becomes grey and yellow. When a near-invisible airhorn punctuates the fade-out... more",/products/raven-be9733ce-98ff-4f47-bc44-2f74e127e709,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916425/product/fislm2O4_Tip23.jpg,2413,x/o,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2413

Spanning their blissed takes on sylvan illbient, early ‘00s electronics, shoegaze jungle and ambient-pop, proper, ‘Natural Wonder Beauty Concept’ lives up to its evocative mantle with some of the most distinctive work in... more",/products/natural-wonder-beauty-concept,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/871173/product/1_%281%29.jpg,2413,x/o,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2413

              (Sea Cucumber)",Sea Cucumber,"MM and Suda reconvene as Async Figure for a bombastic set of baroque club-trap hybrids that sound as upfront as HudMo and as squashed, symphonic and wonky as Lorenzo Senni. Neon, bolshy and playable as all fuck.

The latest in a series of Async Figure releases for Tzusing's Sea Cucumber imprint, 'It's Pulling My Strings' is the duo's most coherent statement yet, a fully upfront, melody-forward mutation of familiar club motifs that's injected with an unmistakably British sense of humor... more",/products/it-s-pulling-my-strings,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/893243/product/5056321691262_T6_Image.jpg,2413,x/o,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2413

If you've been studying club music's experimental fringes you'll no doubt have come across Lila Tirando a Violeta already.
