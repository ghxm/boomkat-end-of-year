Melting traditional Ukranian folk with piano and harmonium improvisations, Nianio pre-empts later wyrd folk developments with a charmed suite that connects outsider forest folk with layered vocal drones and choral motifs to captivating, heart-stopping effect.

              (Horn Of Plenty)",Horn Of Plenty,"Belgian introvert Annelies Monseré's folk experimentation has never sounded more vital than on 'Mares', an unusual, layered interrogation of trauma and memory explored via frothy, confident dirges that straddle court music, experimental minimalism, pulsing electronics and dreamlike drone. It sounds like a baroque-folk cousin to Broadcast’s ‘Tender Buttons’ - with all the goosebump-inducing goo the comparison entails.

Solo piano music has rarely felt more fragile, or hypnotic.

Graham Lambkin's way of approaching the piano is typically idiosyncratic; he knows its cultural weight and his listeners' preconceptions, and still approaches it with anarchic nonchalance: he's as likely to strike... more",/products/aphorisms-ffd9340a-01d3-4ec7-82e1-77309b7ba1c9,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916401/product/aphorisms_Tip23.jpg,2361,Delphine Dora,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2361
