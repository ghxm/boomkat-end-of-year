When post-rock was at its peak in the late-1990s and early-2000s, critics began to tire of the genre's formulaic emotional arc. Quiet would give in to loud, and fizzle into quiet again - rinse and repeat. And when its aesthetic was borrowed by electronic music, leading to the kind of rugged ""power ambient"" that Tim Hecker perfected on phenomenal early releases like 'Radio Amor' and 'Mirages', the same... more",/products/no-highs,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/869585/product/796441823925.jpg,2431,NWAQ,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2431
