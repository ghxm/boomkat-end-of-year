If you've spent any time swiping thru TikTok then you've likely heard the distorted brand of baile funk that's characterised by a clash of sirens, jackhammer beats, long delays and garbled, overlayed Brazilian voices.

For our money it's his most satisfying full-length to date, an earworm-addled/emo pop record that's as strange, poignant and haunted as his breakout 'Diversions 1994-1996'.

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that‚Äôs both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else.
