Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. It’s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if you’re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2311,Yyed,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2311
