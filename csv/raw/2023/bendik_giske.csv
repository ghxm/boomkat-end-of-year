Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else. Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, featuring contributions from Bendik Giske, James Underwood, Lucy Railton and Coby Sey... more",/products/atlas-9a4f61b4-d3d4-4c49-8085-6e9cea1b61a6,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916443/product/Laurel_AOTY.jpg,2300,Bendik Giske,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2300
