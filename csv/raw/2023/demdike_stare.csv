They make a devilish display of interlocking, pointillist drums newly gelled with the addition of harmonic, 4th world woodwind, brass and texture that will completely destroy you - especially... more",/products/joy-in-fear,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/917779/product/13.jpg,2467,Demdike Stare,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2467

Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. It’s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if you’re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2467,Demdike Stare,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2467

The first element to catch our attention on 'Aykathani Malakon' is Sandy Chamoun's bewitching vocal performance, that wraps itself around Farah Kaddour's buzuk and Pascal Semerdjian's clattering percussion on the title track.

Solo piano music has rarely felt more fragile, or hypnotic.

Graham Lambkin's way of approaching the piano is typically idiosyncratic; he knows its cultural weight and his listeners' preconceptions, and still approaches it with anarchic nonchalance: he's as likely to strike... more",/products/aphorisms-ffd9340a-01d3-4ec7-82e1-77309b7ba1c9,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916401/product/aphorisms_Tip23.jpg,2467,Demdike Stare,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2467
