              (NAKID)",NAKID,"New pressing of one of last year’s finest, most sought-after albums, KAKUHAN’s Japanese futureshock ‘Metal Zone’, marrying algorithmic rhythm spasms and electric cello with results that sound like the square root of Photek, Arthur Russell, Beatrice Dillon and Autechre - or something like T++ and Errorsmith dissecting Laurie Anderson’s ‘Home Of The Brave’. It really is that good -  basically all the things we love, in multiples.

A quick peek at SDEM's Bandcamp page rolls out a slew of releases for his own Meds label, CPU, Superpang and Opal Tapes, all of which lay down his idiosyncratic jerky sonics - a finely-tweaked fusion of electro, musique concréte and experimental improv.

Adding to his carousel of pseudonyms (Alexander Lewis, Commix, Covered In sand, Pacific Blue, Shifted), Brewer’s Carrier project explores a more loose-limbed and freeform formula than his usual, bloody-minded focus on a singular thing such as corrosive techno or greyscale noise. Here, granular detail is sprayed into more abstract shapes... more",/products/lazy-mechanics,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/858551/product/5050580802360.jpg,2291,Logos,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2291
