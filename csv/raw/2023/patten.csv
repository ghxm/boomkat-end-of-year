              (Domino Recording Co)",Domino Recording Co,"Perfection from Tirzah once again with perhaps her most loosely structured and hard hitting album to date, as usual produced by Mica Levi, whose chaotic but deeply schooled energy elevates the material here to genuinely all-timer status, using weirdo reverb and doubled up vocal phasing to turn simple hooks into screwed and unforgettable earworms, surrounded by compressed, almost clipped rhythms (the same beat on every track ðŸ¤¯) stretched over lilting piano motifs thatâ€™ll have u... more",/products/trip9love,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916504/product/887828051465_T12_Image_Tip23.jpg,2389,patten,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2389

Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, â€™Corner Dancerâ€™ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. Itâ€™s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if youâ€™re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2389,patten,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2389

The first taste we had of 'Gentle Confrontation' was '2003', the album's most personal track - a sombre, beatless memorial that drapes James' newly confident vocals over a bed of dreamy oohs and ahhs.

It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.

Where her debut album â€˜Holy Palmâ€™ catalogued exotic personal and spiritual travels captured over a 6 year period, â€˜Cold Readingâ€™ details the aftermath; the erosion of fantasy, a breakdown of belief systems, and an overwhelming sense of rootlessness.
