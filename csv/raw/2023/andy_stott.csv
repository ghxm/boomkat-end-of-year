Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ‚ÄôCorner Dancer‚Äô is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty.

For our money it's his most satisfying full-length to date, an earworm-addled/emo pop record that's as strange, poignant and haunted as his breakout 'Diversions 1994-1996'.

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that‚Äôs both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else.
