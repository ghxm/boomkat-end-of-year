""Like a dream foggily remembered, Loopsel’s Öga for Öga is tempting in its beauty yet slightly menacing in its depth. These songs, like paths in the forest forest, are heavily, almost treacherously, reverberated, with finger-plucked guitars acting as your signposts amongst the flora and fauna of field recordings, pads, and the cool, calm voice of Elin Engström.

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else. Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, featuring contributions from Bendik Giske, James Underwood, Lucy Railton and Coby Sey... more",/products/atlas-9a4f61b4-d3d4-4c49-8085-6e9cea1b61a6,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916443/product/Laurel_AOTY.jpg,2277,Jonnine,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2277
