She has played an instrumental role in NYC’s pioneering Downtown scene alongside Arthur Russell, Ellen Fullman, Peter Zummo, Philip Corner and Arnold Dreyblatt, as well as devoting years to the preservation and reappraisal of Julius Eastman’s work since his death in 1990, compiling the ‘Unjust Malaise’ 3CD set in 2005 and editing the 2015 book ‘Gay... more",/products/woodwind-multiples,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916462/product/mary_jane_leach_Tip23.jpg,2415,Claire Fleming,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2415

One of the most convincing debut albums in recent memory, consider it essential listening if you're into KeiyaA, Grouper, Erykah Badu, Dawuna, or Kelela.

Sinclair spent her childhood in the confines of a religious cult in Oklahoma, and on 'Exit... more",/products/exit-simulation,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916478/product/Niecy-Blues_Tip23.jpg,2415,Claire Fleming,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2415

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else. Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, featuring contributions from Bendik Giske, James Underwood, Lucy Railton and Coby Sey... more",/products/atlas-9a4f61b4-d3d4-4c49-8085-6e9cea1b61a6,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916443/product/Laurel_AOTY.jpg,2415,Claire Fleming,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2415

RIYL Blawan, Regis, Rhyw or Rrose.

Stewart steps up his solo game on 'When A Worm Wears A Wig'; he's been releasing material under his own name since 2016, but re-badging his productions as RS Tangent feels like an intentional line in the sand.

The two artists met at Japan's Labyrinth festival, and having been commissioned to do a single remix for Madak, Dozzy found himself so stimulated by what he had to work with that he came back with an hour's worth of... more",/products/plays-bee-mask,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/96661/product/original.jpg,2415,Claire Fleming,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2415
