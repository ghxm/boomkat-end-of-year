Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty.

It's her most dense, celestial and satisfying set to date - essential listening for fans of Éliane Radigue, La Monte Young, Catherine Christer Hennix or Sarah Davachi.

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else.
