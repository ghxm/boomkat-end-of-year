Solo piano music has rarely felt more fragile, or hypnotic.

Graham Lambkin's way of approaching the piano is typically idiosyncratic; he knows its cultural weight and his listeners' preconceptions, and still approaches it with anarchic nonchalance: he's as likely to strike... more",/products/aphorisms-ffd9340a-01d3-4ec7-82e1-77309b7ba1c9,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916401/product/aphorisms_Tip23.jpg,2289,Fielding Hope,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2289
