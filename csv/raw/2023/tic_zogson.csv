Label MVPs since 2013’s introductory Rezzett EP, the duo have become emblematic of rave music’s mutant noisy patch over the past decade with a string of 12”s that led to their acclaimed, eponymous album in 2018. ‘Meant Like This’ makes up five years of near radio-silence with a reliably... more",/products/meant-like-this,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/870758/product/5050580795563.jpg,2362,Tic Zogson,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2362

‘Vidreo’ is among the most satisfying debuts we’ve heard in 2023. Its eight songs are surely defined by the ethereal tenor of Mabe Fratti’s vocals, as beloved from last year's fantastic 'Se Ve Desde Aquí' album for Unheard Of Hope, but here wrapped... more",/products/vidrio,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/917389/product/7.jpg,2362,Tic Zogson,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2362
