              (Domino Recording Co)",Domino Recording Co,"Perfection from Tirzah once again with perhaps her most loosely structured and hard hitting album to date, as usual produced by Mica Levi, whose chaotic but deeply schooled energy elevates the material here to genuinely all-timer status, using weirdo reverb and doubled up vocal phasing to turn simple hooks into screwed and unforgettable earworms, surrounded by compressed, almost clipped rhythms (the same beat on every track ðŸ¤¯) stretched over lilting piano motifs thatâ€™ll have u... more",/products/trip9love,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916504/product/887828051465_T12_Image_Tip23.jpg,2402,Olan Monk,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2402

Alpha Maid's Chuckle was one of 2021â€™s highlights and our blurb at the time placed it in the stylistic vicinity of Mica Leviâ€™s Ruff Dog, so yeah, weâ€™re not massively surprised that this has come to pass.

What you get is 5 short tracks of addictive fuzz, angular and hooky in a way thatâ€™s not a million miles away from early sebadoh or even pavement in the spoken swagger of â€˜Pegâ€™.
