Featuring Voice Actor, Mica Levi, Iceboy Violet, Coby Sey, Richie Culver, RenzNiro and bobbieorkid.

Preston's Rainy Miller and Manchester-Berlin duo Space Afrika have long circled each other, so it was inevitable that their sounds would collide at some point.

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else. Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, featuring contributions from Bendik Giske, James Underwood, Lucy Railton and Coby Sey... more",/products/atlas-9a4f61b4-d3d4-4c49-8085-6e9cea1b61a6,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916443/product/Laurel_AOTY.jpg,2279,Lara Sarkissian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2279

It's so rare for cherished, trailblazing bands to reform and retain their OG energy that it's almost easier to believe it never happens. Slowdive have always had knack for sidestepping expectations though; even when they were releasing their most... more",/products/everything-is-alive,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/898395/product/656605153261.jpg,2279,Lara Sarkissian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2279

Weise's film tells the important tale of resistance fighters and journalists in Ecuador who oppose the transfer of resources to Chinese investors, focusing on life in a troubled mountain village.

Where else might you find manic, distorted gabber blended with ritual chants? Proper good, this one.

The return of one of the c.21st’s most revered techno figures, an ode to the act of chasing vintage body music dragons, dialling up classic spirits with a forthright energy that shows reams of young usurpers how to do it in your own way.

The session is dominated by classic EBM muscle attuned to new flesh. ‘M-87’... more",/products/in-memoriam-d2d621b7-1568-4b07-93f5-bcec6f0f28bb,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916184/product/199994-silent-servant-in-memoriam.jpg,2279,Lara Sarkissian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2279
