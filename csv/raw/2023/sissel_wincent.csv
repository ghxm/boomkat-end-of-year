‘绿帽 Green Hat’ is the 2nd album of strapping club music and computer game-like SFX by Malay born, Taiwan-based artist Tzusing.

Part responsible for steering minimal house somewhere more intriguing by the end of the ‘00s, NYC’s John Roberts has remained inquisitive at the edges of styles in a manner comparable with scene peers such as Nico Jaar and Lawrence over the past decade. ‘Wrecked Exotic’ follows from Roberts’ 2019... more",/products/wrecked-exotic,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/784963/product/4251804132503_2500.jpg,2237,Sissel Wincent,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2237

Better known for twisting his rhythms off the bone for the past decade, AM97 here reads the room’s need for pounding momentum in two steely aces on the ‘Enthusiast’ EP, sandwiching a more typical cut of syncopated electro-grime freakiness.
