Producer JWords and rapper maassai made a splash with 've·loc·i·ty' in 2020, recapturing the forward motion of '90s avant rap and propelling some of those concepts into a complicated new era.

“Stark, cavernous and politically critical dub-poetry lands next on FELT in a vital sign-of-the-times fashion. Where much new music in our scene seems to act as a conduit for escapism, usually via melodic mind-balm or, if vocal at all, lyrical surrealism and ambiguity, the collaborative works of ELDON... more",/products/waterweight,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/897086/product/iya_1.jpg,2337,Geng,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2337

One of the most convincing debut albums in recent memory, consider it essential listening if you're into KeiyaA, Grouper, Erykah Badu, Dawuna, or Kelela.
