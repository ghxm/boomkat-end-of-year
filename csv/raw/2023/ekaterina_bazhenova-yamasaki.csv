2021's 'Medieval Femme' felt like a carefully decorative interweaving of each strand of Al Qadiri's artistic practice. Using Medieval poetry as her inspiration, the veteran Hyperdub polymath was able to invoke ""a simulated daydream through the metaphor of an Islamic garden"", employing a... more",/products/gumar-ep,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/860729/product/5056321638151_T5_Image.jpg,2442,Ekaterina Bazhenova-Yamasaki,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2442

Where her debut album ‘Holy Palm’ catalogued exotic personal and spiritual travels captured over a 6 year period, ‘Cold Reading’ details the aftermath; the erosion of fantasy, a breakdown of belief systems, and an overwhelming sense of rootlessness. A surreal, tripped-out listen, it comes highly recommended if... more",/products/cold-reading,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/902981/product/Cover.jpg,2442,Ekaterina Bazhenova-Yamasaki,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2442

On the latest album, Jamie Stewart explores a recent revelation and is reminded of the power of the band’s music to surprise and connect.

""Faten Kanaan's Afterpoem is a mysterious, smudgy, bittersweet, and uniquely playful album. Deeply melodic, it continues her poignant exploration of counterpoint as a narrative tool. From the repetitive structures of modern minimalism and early music/baroque influences - to more languid textural ebbs & tides, there's a warmth in her use of electronic instruments that gives the album a curiously timeless feel.
