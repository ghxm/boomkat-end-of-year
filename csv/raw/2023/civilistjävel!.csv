""Written in collaboration with producer Fadi Tabbal, the music builds upon Tabbal’s spatial approach to sound and Jallad’s research on Beirut’s Hotel District. The album is a reference to Jallad’s Historic Preservation master's thesis, in which she detailed the history of the “Battle of the Hotels”, a... more",/products/marjaa-the-battle-of-the-hotels,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/853520/product/5056321655974_T13_Image.jpg,2305,Civilistjävel!,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2305

“Stark, cavernous and politically critical dub-poetry lands next on FELT in a vital sign-of-the-times fashion. Where much new music in our scene seems to act as a conduit for escapism, usually via melodic mind-balm or, if vocal at all, lyrical surrealism and ambiguity, the collaborative works of ELDON... more",/products/waterweight,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/897086/product/iya_1.jpg,2305,Civilistjävel!,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2305

When she moved from Scotland to Denmark in the early 2000s, the ghosts of the Celtic north followed Connelly. She found herself surrounded by an unfamiliar ancient landscape that fascinated her and fed her imagination; and when she wrote 'Voyager', her last full-length, she attempted to track down some of the buried... more",/products/wee-rosebud,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/911546/product/5056614709063_T2_Image.jpg,2305,Civilistjävel!,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2305

Ghostly and completely transfixing material, it sounds like a pitch-black reduction of Talk Talk's ‘Spirit of Eden’ crumbling into Julee Cruise's ‘Floating into the Night’.
