Pilia and Tricoli have been playing together for long enough to instinctively know how to react to each other's improvisations. ""Cantor Park"" features Pilia playing live on guitar and modular synth, reacting to Tricoli's freeform tape manipulations. Tricoli eventually took the... more",/products/cantor-park,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/848811/product/5056321684721_T3_Image.jpg,2445,Koshiro Hino,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2445

‘The Blue Beyond’ is Winderen’s first release since 2018, and derives from commissions by Audemars Piguet Contemporary for installation and live performances at Art Basel in Basel and Miami.

Structured around pristine piano, percussion and voice, ‘The Beat My Head Hit' is something completely different from Vida- and we mean completely.

Anyone who's kept a close eye on Nyege Nyege's movements in the past few years will have probably come across Nakibembe Embaire Group.
