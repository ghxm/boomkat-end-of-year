              (Warm Winters Ltd.)",Warm Winters Ltd.,"Microtonal zither twangs, off-world vocals and k-hole sonic wonders characterise Martyna Basta's brilliant second album, a crepuscular muddle of improvisations and granular invocations.

Martyna Basta's 'Making Eye Contact With Solitude'Â took us by surprise, demolishing the borders between electro-acoustic experimentation, wyrd folk and ambient music by infusing scholarly expertise with raw, unbounded passion. Its followup pushes even deeper into the unknown, crumpling real-world... more",/products/slowly-forgetting-barely-remembering,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916381/product/5050580799516_Tip23.jpg,2323,Dania,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2323

Burroughs and FÃ©licia Atkinson.
