              (OTOROKU)",OTOROKU,"Sunik Kim's new album is a frantic conflation of giddy General MIDI instrumentation, homespun RPG fantasies and Henry Cow's inaccessible freeform improvisation. Cyborg music for the information age's dying gasps - RIYL Stockhausen, James Ferraro, Roland Kayn or Carl Stone.

Within seconds of the 23-minute opening side, Kim drags us into a sonic biodome powered by haphazard, fictile orchestral blasts, redlined, stuttering percussion and tinny, 16-bit videogame fanfares.

              (Mexican Summer)",Mexican Summer,"Taja Cheek's third L'Rain album is a mangled tapestry of psychedelic rock, R&B, radio pop, prog and folk references that's woven with distinctly unique threads. Brimming with sensually familiar earworms and devious, experimental touches, it's like hearing musical history reframed with rare literacy and spirit. Massive recommendation, whether yr into Joan Baez, TV On The Radio, serpentwithfeet or Moses Sumney.

It takes a well-trained ear to form such divergent elements into... more",/products/i-killed-your-dog,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916568/product/184923134667-3_Tip23.jpg,2385,Lucy Liyou,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2385
