Each track is titled and sequenced by the date in which it was written, culminating in a collection of music that provides an intimate snapshot into this period of Sakamoto’s life. R.I.P., legend.

Of the album, RYUICHI SAKAMOTO says, “In early March 2021, I finally ‘came home’ to my new temporary housing after a big operation and a long stay in the hospital.

Ambarchi and Avenaim have been friends and collaborators for over 35 years, and they distinctly remember going to see The Necks together in the late '80s, being stunned by Abrahams' characteristically unique piano playing.

Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty.

When post-rock was at its peak in the late-1990s and early-2000s, critics began to tire of the genre's formulaic emotional arc. Quiet would give in to loud, and fizzle into quiet again - rinse and repeat. And when its aesthetic was borrowed by electronic music, leading to the kind of rugged ""power ambient"" that Tim Hecker perfected on phenomenal early releases like 'Radio Amor' and 'Mirages', the same... more",/products/no-highs,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/869585/product/796441823925.jpg,2346,Félicia Atkinson,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2346
