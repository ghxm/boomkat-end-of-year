‘Heart Stopper’ was recorded 2019-2022 and bears strong traces of Morelli’s tenure in Paris manifest in its french touch filter-house nudges and kinky gallic gait, which finely balances the album’s more scowling industrial parts, made with a relatively heart-on-sleeve style of melodic sequencing, vocal parts and craftier rhythm... more",/products/heart-stopper-9e04d2fd-391a-4645-95c6-b71907b0be8c,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/860075/product/0840200594400.jpg,2329,Robin Stewart,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2329

When Wright lost their father suddenly in 2020, they channeled their grief into their work, attempting to mirror the process they were experiencing.

The first new Karenn sesh since 2020’s ‘Music Sounds Better With Shoe’ lands with the dance packed again, delivering four propulsive screwballs marked by weirdo production tics and vocals.

‘Feeling Horizontal’ boots it off like Yello’s Carlos Peron jamming with Green Velvet, and ‘Happy Birthday’ tilts Chicago butterfly rhythms thru a gauntlet of trippy modular filters. ‘From Hunk to Husk’ is one of the titles of the year and sounds... more",/products/everything-is-curly,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/878220/product/8718723229388.jpg,2329,Robin Stewart,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2329

‘Dismantled into Juice’ is also his 2nd for XL after the watershed moment of ‘Woke Up Right Handed’, where his typically unruly techno style went totally off course into non-standard meters and chewy textures with wild abandon.

On all five cuts here he flies the freak flag proudly between the acrid, chuddy gob of ‘Toast’, a deep... more",/products/distmantled-into-juice,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/876653/product/191404133057_T6_Image.jpg,2329,Robin Stewart,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2329
