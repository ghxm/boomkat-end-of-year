              (Tresor Records)",Tresor Records,"Moritz von Oswald's latest solo album is his most startling, time-bending material since the Basic Channel days, a collaboration with a 16-voice choir that refracts techno and choral music into dizzying psychedelic traces, exploiting mind-altering xenharmonic synth tones, Ligeti-like operatic phrases and abyssal kicks with a veteran's cunning. We've been knocked sideways by this one - trans-dimensional afters music at its absolute best.

We realise that there's been a lot of electronic music... more",/products/silencio-3625e04d-8335-4a7c-96f1-c17b599bae58,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916473/product/moritz_Tip23.jpg,2219,Richard Skelton,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2219

It's a devilishly specific sound, recalling bits of Basinski and FUJI||||||||||TA, but steeped in GRM lore gliding into liminal states where things are never quite what they seem.

With a title like ‘Shifted in Dreams’, you might expect Bonnet to grip onto a shoegaze-ambient third rail and shock himself into latter-day... more",/products/shifted-in-dreams,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/854217/product/SP144_Cover.jpg,2219,Richard Skelton,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2219
