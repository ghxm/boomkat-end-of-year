Sinead O’Connor (b. 1966, ✝ 2023) was a ubiquitous influence and hero to many who grew up in the ’80s, ‘90s and beyond.

              (15 love)",15 love,"Danish producer ML Buch studies the fertile space between vintage songcraft and contemporary synthetics on 'Suntub', smudging MIDI guitar riffs and soft rock pads into acoustic instrumentation and soaring earworms. It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.

Where her debut album ‘Holy Palm’ catalogued exotic personal and spiritual travels captured over a 6 year period, ‘Cold Reading’ details the aftermath; the erosion of fantasy, a breakdown of belief systems, and an overwhelming sense of rootlessness. A surreal, tripped-out listen, it comes highly recommended if... more",/products/cold-reading,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/902981/product/Cover.jpg,2341,Spivak,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2341
