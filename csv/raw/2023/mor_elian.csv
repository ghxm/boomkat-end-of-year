Previously found dicing with techno dancehall on the Berlin-based Fever AM label he runs with Mor Elian, here Rhyw is in strident effect with a clutch of lean, shatterproof air-benders built for peak time momentum. A clue to his steez is in the title ‘Mister Melt’, as he presents acidic forms in flux between hi-velocity techno and garage, each riddled with... more",/products/mister-melt,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/905307/product/FAM12.jpg,2217,Mor Elian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2217

The keenly awaited ‘With a Hammer’ catches Kathy Yaeji Lee in uniquely agile form mutating her special blend of tropes from the house spectrum with memory updates of D&B, K-Pop, skudged downbeats and ‘90s grunge for a sweetly satisfying... more",/products/with-a-hammer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/868691/product/191404900956_T14_Image.jpg,2217,Mor Elian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2217

A prime showcase of east Africa’s incredibly fertile electronic dance music scene, ‘Kubali’ catches Uganda-born, Kenya-based MC Yallah step on and off 11 seriously ruffshod productions blessed with the best of both scuzzy industrial fetish styles and up-to-the-second global bass/trap movements.

‘Dismantled into Juice’ is also his 2nd for XL after the watershed moment of ‘Woke Up Right Handed’, where his typically unruly techno style went totally off course into non-standard meters and chewy textures with wild abandon.

On all five cuts here he flies the freak flag proudly between the acrid, chuddy gob of ‘Toast’, a deep... more",/products/distmantled-into-juice,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/876653/product/191404133057_T6_Image.jpg,2217,Mor Elian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2217

James Holden has had a wild ride of it. As a teen he was fascinated by the pirate radio stations he'd just about be able to tune into from his dull West Midlands village, and before he'd hit 20 he was already producing major label dance music and touring... more",/products/imagine-this-is-a-high-dimensional-space-of-all-possibilities,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/861899/product/5051083186025.jpg,2217,Mor Elian,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2217
