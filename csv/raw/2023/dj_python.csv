A low-key legend in the New Zealand scene, Funke has put significant work into her output since the mid-'00s, playing in $100 Band before carving out a niche for herself as an idiosyncratic solo artist.

Repping for the much hyped Parisian scene, ‘Cuspide Des Sirènes’ weighs in a far more significant payload that his ‘Yes.DJ’ of 2021, vacillating club, and club-adjacent pieces, with passages of sinewy cinematic goo that suggest the work as a long-playing story, not an EP of fuel for DJs/dancers.

              (Recital)",Recital,"'Sending Up A Spiral Of' is US sound artist Sydney Spann's first vinyl release, and works as a neatly-presented introduction to their idiosyncratic catalog. Using environmental recordings, vocals, sine tones and rough, tactile sounds, Spann brings attention to the language and love of care workers, working obscure lullabies into her peculiar compositions.

Only a few seconds into the 20-minute title track of 'Sending Up A Spiral Of', it's pretty clear we're in for something special.
