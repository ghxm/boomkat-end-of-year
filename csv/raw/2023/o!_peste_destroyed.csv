A hodgepodge of lo-fi pop songs, experiments and location recordings that sound like they were never intended for public consumption, it’s by chance or design one of the most moving, personal, memorable DIY/experimental pop albums of the 20th century, you better believe it.

After a multi-part retrospective, and lending her tongue-tip magic to a re-composition of Ernstalbrecht Stiebler’s ‘Für Biliana’ already in 2023, Davachi now presents a real beauty that was borne of an unusually long compositional process, and follows with a definitive... more",/products/long-gradus,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/902707/product/5056614708271_T5_Image.jpg,2465,O!

Deep, atmospheric music, it comes highly recommended if you’re into Cosey Fanni Tutti, Annea Lockwood, Kate Bush, Ana Roxanne, Aaron Dilloway.
