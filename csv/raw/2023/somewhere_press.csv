Whatever you’re expecting, this probably ain’t it - a gently screwed set of sunstroke/desert songs like some Nico x AC Marias x Leslie Winer session; out of body, sleep deprived, somewhere between delirium and bliss.

Martyna Basta's 'Making Eye Contact With Solitude' took us by surprise, demolishing the borders between electro-acoustic experimentation, wyrd folk and ambient music by infusing scholarly expertise with raw, unbounded passion.
