Chasing up irsh’s Cairene showcases studded with cuts by 1127, ZULI, ABADIR, Kareem Lotfy, 3Phaz, and many more, Qow’s dissection and reassembly of works by Egyptian singer Sherine Abdel-Wahab manifests the label’s first original artist release.

If you've spent any time swiping thru TikTok then you've likely heard the distorted brand of baile funk that's characterised by a clash of sirens, jackhammer beats, long delays and garbled, overlayed Brazilian voices. That's Bruxaria, a sound that emerged from Baile do Helipa, a street party... more",/products/panico-no-submundo,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/882690/product/768558901339.jpg,2354,Sarra Wild,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2354

2021's 'Medieval Femme' felt like a carefully decorative interweaving of each strand of Al Qadiri's artistic practice.
