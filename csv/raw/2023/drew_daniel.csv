Plenty of people have tried this, few have passed the muster: absolutely indispensable if yr interested in anything from Plastikman and Pan Sonic to James Tenney, Pauline Oliveros and Charlemagne Palestine.

Orcutt might be best known for his freeform attack on blues, but his technique is equally as enthralling when mapped to rootsy American folk. 'Jump On It' is a relatively restrained set from the ex-Harry Pussy shredder, and benefits from its resistance to... more",/products/jump-on-it,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/858432/product/A10369V00000010582_T95226779150054.jpg,2422,Drew Daniel,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2422
