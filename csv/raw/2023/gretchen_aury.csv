              (OTOROKU)",OTOROKU,"Sunik Kim's new album is a frantic conflation of giddy General MIDI instrumentation, homespun RPG fantasies and Henry Cow's inaccessible freeform improvisation. Cyborg music for the information age's dying gasps - RIYL Stockhausen, James Ferraro, Roland Kayn or Carl Stone.

Within seconds of the 23-minute opening side, Kim drags us into a sonic biodome powered by haphazard, fictile orchestral blasts, redlined, stuttering percussion and tinny, 16-bit videogame fanfares.

‘Legacy Volume 2’ hails the happiest man in footwork with 13 stuttering shots spanning tunes found on the groundbreaking ‘Bangs & Works’ compilation thru to unreleased material produced during footwork’s formative years 2002-2007. Justifiably claimed as “to footwork what Juan Atkins is to techno”, RP Boo can also rightly be heard as its Dilla or Pete Rock for his innovative... more",/products/legacy-volume-2,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/865887/product/5056321682420_T14_Image.jpg,2400,Gretchen Aury,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2400

Flipping the concept of turntable-based music on its head, she fractures free jazz, noise, death drone and operatic fragments into a broken tangle of spinbacks, pitchbends, loping rhythms and perverted side-eyes.
