Following from class club cuts on his ‘Cubo Live Sessions’ volumes and the distinctly gallic charm of his kosmiche ambient house album ‘Eye Cube’, Nicolas Chaix’s logn-runnign project brings his various circles together in this live manifesto. It features as a full 50 minute recording, and a 7 handy extracts and distillations of the vibe... more",/products/i-cube-live-at-forum-des-halles,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/913777/product/cover.jpg,2333,Gilb’R,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2333

              (Melody As Truth)",Melody As Truth,"Jonny Nash presents his sixth solo album, a ""personal folk"" album that blurs discernible songs into ghostly, dream pop memories, coming across like Durutti Column, Brian Eno or Grouper.

We reckon ambient folk has to be a genre by now, right? Nash's 'Point of Entry' is certainly a solid representation of the genre, drawing from his work with Gigi Masin and Young Marco as Gaussian Curve just as much as it does his recent run of trad folk-inspired plates.

High vibrational gear for advanced psychedelic explorers, this one's a fine addition to Shackleton's rapidly swelling canon - it's like ritual music assembled with the sensibility of Talk Talk, Zbigniew Preisner and Leaving Records' Arushi Jain.
