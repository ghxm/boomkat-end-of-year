              (NAKID)",NAKID,"Perhaps the tightest band in existence right now return with an astonishing new album - their first in 8 years - we ain’t talking about the Swedish psych troupe, nor the Greek metal act; but the infinitely superior Japanese goat (jp) who take the micro-precision of computer music and play it on instruments. They make a devilish display of interlocking, pointillist drums newly gelled with the addition of harmonic, 4th world woodwind, brass and texture that will completely destroy you - especially... more",/products/joy-in-fear,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/917779/product/13.jpg,2370,Andrew Hargreaves,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2370

              (Sacred Bones Records)",Sacred Bones Records,"Hilary Woods, notoriously one time member of JJ72, builds on the arid mystery of 2021's genius 'Feral Hymns' with the crepuscular 'Acts of Light', featuring nine creeping dirges played on double bass, field recordings and choral chants that sound like mournful, Celtic ghosts wailing into a moonlit woodland. Brilliantly unsettling material, tipped for anyone into GAS, Deathprod, György Ligeti or Antonina Nowacka.

Each track is titled and sequenced by the date in which it was written, culminating in a collection of music that provides an intimate snapshot into this period of Sakamoto’s life. R.I.P., legend.
