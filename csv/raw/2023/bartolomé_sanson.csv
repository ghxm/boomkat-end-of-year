Travelling from reverberating, unaccompanied vocal works for tape, to death blues exhortations, blistering amp worship, and his more typical finger-picking folk; ‘Proofs and Refutations’ is a staggering posthumous addition to John Fahey’s 40+ year body of work, arguably thrilling like the recent revelation of Arthur Russell’s... more",/products/proofs-and-refutations,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/887542/product/781484075929.jpg,2419,Bartolomé Sanson,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2419
