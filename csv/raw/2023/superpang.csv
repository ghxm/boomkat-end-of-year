The two experimental legends first collaborated on 2018's 'Nordlicht', a heady collection of subs and drone experiments that harked back to Roedelius's earliest material. 'II' is a continuation of those ideas, focusing the duo's energy on three... more",/products/ii-cee666e6-295f-4036-b642-1cc7fcd4314e,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/875898/product/iDEAL211_Cover.jpg,2310,Superpang,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2310

Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. It’s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if you’re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2310,Superpang,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2310

The Necks’ Chris Abrahams (piano, Hammond organ), Tony Buck (drums, percussion, electric guitar) and Lloyd Swanton (bass guitar, double bass) re-ignite a mesmerising minimalism on ‘Travel’, taken from very lightly edited and... more",/products/travel-e4f5a497-784e-4430-82ba-9550fc69ea44,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916550/product/The_Necks_Tip23.jpg,2310,Superpang,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2310

At Groningen’s Jazz Marathon festival in 1990 (on vinyl), and the New Music Cafe, NYC in 1991 (on digital), we’re witness to a remarkably lissom, even melodic performance by Bailey, the grand master of... more",/products/duo-in-concert,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/903913/product/FR24V_cover.jpg,2310,Superpang,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2310
