Adding to his carousel of pseudonyms (Alexander Lewis, Commix, Covered In sand, Pacific Blue, Shifted), Brewer’s Carrier project explores a more loose-limbed and freeform formula than his usual, bloody-minded focus on a singular thing such as corrosive techno or greyscale noise. Here, granular detail is sprayed into more abstract shapes... more",/products/lazy-mechanics,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/858551/product/5050580802360.jpg,2377,Akira Rabelais,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2377
