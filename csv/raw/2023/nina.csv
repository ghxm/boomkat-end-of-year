Blurring distinctions between structured composition and more visceral modes of performance, ’Corner Dancer’ is full of bristling, charged energies, dissolving into sections of almost incomprehensible beauty. It’s one of the most quietly radical albums of the year, required listening if you’re into Maryanne Amacher, HTRK... more",/products/corner-dancer,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916458/product/Lucy_Railton_Tip23.jpg,2446,Nina,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2446

Utterly reeking of Ork armpits and putrefied meat, ‘Ritual Giblets’ lays out a feast of extreme hard rock and metal entrails by artists who have us by the short and curlies for the duration.

Jazz has long been Demdike’s mutual teacher, underlining the duo’s respective journeys from hip hop and rave in ‘90s mcr, to a growing obsession fostered by years hunting and trading rare nuggets.
