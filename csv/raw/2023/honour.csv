Asking what happens when we dream, Liyou softens the fantasy with soaring vocals, scintillating jazzy piano phrases and subtly industrial textures, channeling Julee Cruise, claire rousay and Robert Ashley all at once.

Artistry can be a little like magic when aesthetic concerns are put to one side and personal perspective takes over.
