Both musicians are perhaps best known for their roles in Dirty Three (though they have been known to take time off to work with Bonnie 'Prince' Billy and Cat Power).

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else. Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, featuring contributions from Bendik Giske, James Underwood, Lucy Railton and Coby Sey... more",/products/atlas-9a4f61b4-d3d4-4c49-8085-6e9cea1b61a6,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/916443/product/Laurel_AOTY.jpg,2472,Anja Lauvdal,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2472
