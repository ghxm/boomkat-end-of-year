              (Blank Forms Editions)",Blank Forms Editions,"Shadow Ring frontman Graham Lambkin returns with his first proper album in seven years, an extended ""transatlantic meditation"" that tries to make sense of the artist's move back to the UK after almost two decades in the USA.

After supplying the 2nd release on 12th Isle with ‘Blubber Totum’ in 2017, Cru Servers’ Rickie & Jamie McNeill have lain low in the studio, marinating hardware in a sticky secret sauce that has become a hallmark of their chewy, downbeat productions. ‘Eel’ oozes with that special crud on eight original works that slunk in the sort of grooves also followed... more",/products/eel-3ae8322b-8832-42d2-a8ba-4c8c40e590c9,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/856795/product/8718723218825.jpg,2244,Luke Younger,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2244
