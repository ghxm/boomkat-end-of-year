              (Fiction)",Fiction,"Faith was released in 1981 and is the second and probably the best in the 'Fatalistic kingdom' trio of albums from The Cure. Fuelled by Simon Gallup’s Fender bass - in turns deep, angular, growling and comforting - for our money it's one of the most sparse and singular albums to ever edge into the mainstream.

The monochromatic cover image (a picture of Bolton Priory in the fog, painted by The Cure’s Porl Thompson) gives away the mood here; funereal, downcast, brooding, containing some... more",/products/faith-a7860d97-9851-4f9e-ba48-6b5e1a7a40c5,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/370091/product/R-2264744-1273199644.jpeg.jpg,2220,Sarah Davachi,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2220

As a result of some international underground acclaim in fanzines and mailorder catalogs – for both the album and a striking 7-inch, “The Fate of the Human Carbine,” released around the same time – it soon appeared on LP and CD as well, through the Ajax label of Chicago.

Of course, I don't actually know the feller, but after listening to 'Omns' there's no doubt in my mind that he is on a different universal plane than the rest of us.
