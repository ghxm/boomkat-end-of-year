Raised on ‘80s video nasties and the sound of seafront arcade machines in the UK’s most beloved, if knackered, resort, VHS Head has made a virtue of his home town’s putative reputation since the ‘Video Club’ EP and via subsequent albums ‘Trademark Ribbon of Gold’ and ‘Persistence of Vision’.

Six years since his debut Japan Blues album ‘Sells His Record Collection’, Williams is back - and it’s been worth the wait.

More abstract cinematique than the roiling rhythms gathered on the first instalment, this next volume breaks down between passages of atmospheric filmic dialogue and feral no-wave industrial that cuts layers deeper into Geins’t Naït’s uncompromising oeuvre.
