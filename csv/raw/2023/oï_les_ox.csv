Jamie Krasner's 2016 debut ""PET"" impressed because the NYC artist was able to successfully deconstruct pop forms without losing the elements that drew us to those sounds in the first place.

There's a polar interplay between vastly different kinds of musical and artistic signaling on ""Woodwind Quintet"" that makes it fascinating.

If you've only heard Pekler's dubby, experimental abstractions, then 'For Lovers Only / Rain Suite' will come as a surprise.
