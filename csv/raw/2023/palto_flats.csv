Sprouted by the 29 Speedway label belonging to Ex Wiish (who just dropped an ace album on Incienso),’Flat Earth’ shares the first collaborations by two mutually low key players from the NYC undergrowth.

Chasing up his 2022 EP with Equiknoxx bandmate Jord for Jon k & Elle Andrews’ MAL, Gavsborg flips expectations at every turn on ‘1 Hour Service’ with an abundance of expressive keyboard chops alloyed to lysergic slants on contemporary and ancient dancehall modes.
