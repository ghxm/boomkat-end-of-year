With peerless production and songwriting credits to his name for everyone from Depeche Mode to Yazoo and Erasure, Vince Clarke’s position in the synth music hall of fame is assured. Since 1980 he has methodically synced... more",/products/songs-of-silence,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/911328/product/5400863142063.jpg,2295,Kareem,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2295

Falling in line with examples set by Kareem and Catharsis, ‘Blood Pact’ follows 11XXX27’s clutch on release on his Infidel Bodies label with a subtle expansion and refinement of his sound benefiting from Mystics’ production. They find a fine balance of instrumental synth dread, club muscularity and biting point noise as the... more",/products/blood-pact,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/871377/product/ZHARK038_Cover.jpg,2295,Kareem,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2295

Manning their 2nd release and the 3rd on Krakow’s Wodawater, TRSSX harnesses his kit to trampling formations bound to resonate with followers of Conrad pack & Gonz or Ancient Methods. He comes slathering mad with the churned up kicks and tunnelling monotone of ‘Trespass Nonexistence’, and like a demented Blawan on ‘A Thousand Norths’ beside the gnashing attack of ‘One by One by One’... more",/products/deforming-assimilation,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/875851/product/trssx-flat_image.jpg,2295,Kareem,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2295
