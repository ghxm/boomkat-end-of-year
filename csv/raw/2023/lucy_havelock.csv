Quite simply ‘World of Echo’ is among the most important, groundbreaking avant-pop records of the late c.20th, so the release of ‘Picture of Bunny Rabbit’ after 38 years in the archive is nothing short of momentous.

It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.
