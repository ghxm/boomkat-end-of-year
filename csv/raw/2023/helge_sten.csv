              (Biophon Records (Norway))",Biophon Records,"Ambient legend Gier Jenssen goes back to basics on 'Inland Delta', improvising on an arsenal of reconditioned vintage synths and mimicking Vangelis, Tangerine Dream and Jean-Michel Jarre.

After masterminding richly conceptual records like 2016's 'Departed Glories' and 2021's 'Angel's Flight', Jenssen revived his love of analog gear on May's 'Shortwave Memories', using old preset-free synths to craft an ode to the early days of post-punk. 'Inland Delta' expands the reach; this time he's used... more",/products/inland-delta-58949381-fd6b-401c-bd4b-533148e0c5e4,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/910474/product/7090029003932.jpg,2275,Helge Sten,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2275

              (Smalltown Supersound)",Smalltown Supersound,"Carmen Villain follows last years ‘Only Love From Now On’ with this new full length exploration of soporific, slow-moving ambience and disemboweled dub, a score she composed for a contemporary dance performance by acclaimed Choreographer Eszter Salamon. Simply put, it’s one of the most captivating things we’ve heard this year; all luxurious texture-cycles in possession of a delirious, dreamlike quality that hits a rarified spot somewhere between Aphex Twin’s ‘Selected Ambient Works... more",/products/music-from-the-living-monument,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/875856/product/cover.jpg,2275,Helge Sten,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2275

Yep this one’s pushing the right buttons for that brand of Scandi brutalism that’s close to our hearts. To be honest we haven’t encountered the work of Brutter before, but we definitely recognise the sort of tekkerz on show from decades drawn to Pan Sonic and their nuclear fallout in the... more",/products/outta,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/902324/product/SONATA078_Cover.jpg,2275,Helge Sten,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2275
