              (Partisan Records)",Partisan Records,"PJ Harvey's first album since 2016's politically-charged 'The Hope Six Demolition Project' is a lavish and singular treat, inspired by her epic poem 'Orlam' and littered with Biblical imagery and Shakespearean nods.

How many artists actually reach the ten album mark and still manage to challenge and exceed themselves? PJ Harvey hits that milestone with expected panache, plunging into the folkloric magicl realism of her 2022-released novel-in-verse 'Orlam' (written in Dorset dialect, no less) to... more",/products/inside-the-old-year-dying,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/884528/product/0720841303206.jpg,2357,DJ Sundae,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2357

‘Searchlight Moonbeam’ leads on from the acclaimed DJ tag team’s ‘Ballads’, and a succession of NTS shows, into meta-autumnal landscapes that... more",/products/searchlight-moonbeam,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/917387/product/8.jpg,2357,DJ Sundae,2023,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2023/2357

Whisper-quiet and unfathomably moving, it's essential listening for anyone into Sibylle Baier, Linda Perhacs or Jessica Pratt.

Back in 1987, Loren Mazzacane Connors wasn't yet a household name, despite having already recorded prolifically and played live regularly.
