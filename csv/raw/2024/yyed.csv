              (Fönstret / Lisa Ullén)",Fönstret / Lisa Ullén,"Sunning material from Stockholm-based improviser Lisa Ullén, stretching the concept of the solo piano album by juxtaposing two discrete versions of the same three part suite on each side of the same record. It's striking and deep work that balances prepared piano in a way we haven’t quite heard before, at one moment channeling Feldman’s minimalism, before embracing the mystery and romance of midnight jazz.

Although Ullén has been recording and releasing music for years, both as a... more",/products/heirloom-0d083291-2a80-463d-b1b1-65a5523390cb,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/922920/product/cover.jpg,2733,YYED,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2733

There's plenty of organ music around at the minute, but 'The Head...' undoubtedly sets a new high: sonorous, cryptic, endlessly inquisitive music that pulses with mystery and supernatural awe.

An established visual artist and pianist, Balon cracks open his sonic universe on this one, clustering seemingly disparate ideas and elements into a cryptic, intimate narrative.

Properly delicate, weird, polychromatic pulp for fans of Voice Actor, Salenta + Topu, Laila Sakini, Coby Sey, Tricky, Jörg Follert.
