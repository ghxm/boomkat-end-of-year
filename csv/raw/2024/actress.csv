Equally known as a dance-starter and composer of filigree melodic delicacies, Upsammy has, over the past five years, emerged among Europe’s leading proponents of electronica in that vein of interest that reaches back thru Aleksi Perälä’s colundi... more",/products/strange-meridians,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/970149/product/8720246797435.jpg,2579,Actress,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2579
