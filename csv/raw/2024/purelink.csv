Trading under an archaic name for Leeds, Loidis goes on like a long weekend in one of its infamous club or house parties, rolling out deep and long with eight hypnotically immersive cuts distinguished by his trippy surface detailing and heavily infectious grooves.

Swinging silken tarraxo syncopations around wavey synths and breathy vocals to forward a unique vision of cosmic, syruppy soul/R&B, it’s a properly heady album of late night batida heaters from what is, still, one of the world’s most forward facing labels.
