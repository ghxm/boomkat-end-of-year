              (Motion Ward)",Motion Ward,"Fizzing thru the aether like a half-remembered dream, Ulla and Ultrafog's collaborative debut is a surreal shimmer of imploded shoegaze-y guitar riffs, thick subs and lassoed vocals. Like an especially dissociated strain of hypnagogic pop, its sequence of trace recollections netted into a syrup of entrancing and half-speed ambience comes highly recommended if you’ve enjoyed work by Perila, Romance, Vincent Gallo, claire rousay or Oval. 

Not quite as smoky and diaphanous as Ultrafog's... more",/products/it-means-a-lot,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/929880/product/ea195d90-74bd-1643-0da7-5db42e0bdc82.png,2617,Naemi,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2617

              (4AD)",4AD,"Widening the aspect ratio and raising the budget, Portuguese-Danish prodigy Erika de Casier retains her tight grip on R&B nostalgia with 'Still', simultaneously poking around reggaetón and PinkPantheress-style soft jungle. It's more effortlessly intimate, club-friendly gear that'll be haunting ur mind long after it's finished - featuring guest spots from Shygirl, Blood Orange and They Hate Change.

'Lucky' might be driven by modish minced, jungly breakbeats, but look under the hood and you'll... more",/products/still-a9f35451-6dcd-4f51-a3cc-73943d1b3a70,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925547/product/191400063969_T15_Image.jpg,2617,Naemi,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2617

              (15 love)",15 love,"Danish producer ML Buch studies the fertile space between vintage songcraft and contemporary synthetics on 'Suntub', smudging MIDI guitar riffs and soft rock pads into acoustic instrumentation and soaring earworms. It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.
