Remarkable stuff, the perfect follow-up to Ishibashi's beloved 'Drive My Car' score, with every nuance mixed & mastered by Jim O’Rourke.

When Ishibashi was asked to put together an A/V set for a series of overseas shows, she wondered if Hamaguchi might want to collaborate.

Even though 'Rocky Top Ballads' is Fine's first fully fleshed-out solo offering, she operates from the center of Denmark's fertile alt-pop scene.

There's definitely something in the water right now in Denmark. Molina's debut album, written while she was pregnant, is familiar, but not because it sounds like her peers' output, exactly.
