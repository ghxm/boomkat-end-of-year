""Jeff Witscher has been one of the most daring voices in underground American music for two decades, highlighted by releases on Pan and NNA Tapes.

Landing somewhere between Neil Young and Pavement, it's modern American folk-pop that's bursting with feeling.

'Manning Fireworks' is Lenderman's most lavish record yet; his country-indie stomp has been tamed a little here, with fiddles and twangy acoustic bass sounds peeking between the lap steel whines and pensive acoustic... more",/products/manning-fireworks,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/955749/product/a1888800323_10.jpg,2594,Fergus Jones,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2594
