              (Bison Records)",Bison Records,"Genuinely smart art school rock is hard to come by, but Still House Plants make it sound easy, welding subtly R&B-inflected vocals to fractured, free jazz-cum-post rock drums and Shellac-strength axe acrobatics on their incredible third album. Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over. Tortoise were making firmer connections with Chicago's... more",/products/if-i-don-t-make-it-i-love-u,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925177/product/5056688817176_T12_Image.jpg,2595,Mariam Rezaei,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2595

Playing regularly together for over two decades, Ambarchi and Johan Berthling have ironed out their creases, devising an almost psychic ability to create magic out of the most bare ingredients.

There's nothing particularly new about 'Anemones', but it's so well done it hardly matters. On 'Jelena', Backhouse adheres to the melodic logic of 'I Care Because You Do', playing wistful synth tones over frequency-shifted breaks.
