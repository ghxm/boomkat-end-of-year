              (A Colourful Storm)",A Colourful Storm,"A Colourful Storm unearth this killer 2009 album from beloved Japanese acid folk band Eddie Marcon, bringing it to vinyl for the first time. It's softly-spoken, delicate and frayed at the edges - completely essential listening if ur into Ai Aso, Tenniscoats or Maher Shalal Hash Baz.

We first came across Eddie Marcon way back in '05, when the band welded together two of their earliest CDRs into the (pre Longform Editions) Preservation-released 'Shining on Graveposts'. It took us completely by surprise... more",/products/yahho-no-potori,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/933964/product/4251804191142_2500.jpg,2645,Thea Hudson-Davies,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2645

Proper soft-landing gear, tipped if you’re into Arve Henriksen, ECM, Flanger, Conjoint.

You've got to respect Freya Tate and Moina Moin's determination here. On the opening track 'céilí', a loosely familiar recorder phrase - no doubt referencing the titular Celtic dance - is transformed into a chant and then a galloping, Björk-like hybrid dance track that disassembles and... more",/products/slif-slaf-slof,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/939849/product/829732000566.jpg,2645,Thea Hudson-Davies,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2645
