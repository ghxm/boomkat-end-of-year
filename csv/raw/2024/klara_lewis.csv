Ex-Women frontperson Patrick Flegel's vision of rock 'n roll is anachronistically nostalgic, an oily tincture of vintage psych, dilated funk and ghosted girl group pop that stews in its heartbreaking sincerity. Urgent listening for fans of Jessica Pratt, Brian Wilson, The Walker Brothers, U.S. Girls or Karen... more",/products/diamond-jubilee-4ded0054-8acb-4340-b091-4fbcd3f633e1,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/963386/product/W25-18_web_1024x1024.jpg,2589,Klara Lewis,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2589

How do you remix work that's not just purposefully crooked, but heartbreakingly personal? Turns out, Lewis knew exactly who to ask. Stockholm-based multi-instrumentalist Westlin's calm, thoughtful version of '4U' is more of a cover than a remix, but he zeroes in on the track's emotional core rather than its... more",/products/thankful-remixes,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/968597/product/880918269399.jpg,2589,Klara Lewis,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2589

Kane, but ultimately just Mica’s thing.
