              (Matador)",Matador,"With over four decades of relentless reinvention and innovation under her belt, Kim Gordon embraces failure on her mind-boggling latest solo LP, rapping and groaning over industrialized, hybrid trap beats that push so far into the red they almost disintegrate. Where a lesser presence could have let that production dominate, Gordon is always the total focus of our attention, the rhythm - as sick as it is - functions almost like a stock backing track, such is her shine. Essential gear.

              (Modern Love)",Version / Love,"Modern Love with a new 7” series reserved for asymmetric bangers and pop diversions, opening with a double A-side from Andy Stott, his first single in 11 years.

Inna bare, dancehall style ‘Out (Version)’ on the A side feels out skeletal drums and stabs for a pure adrenaline rush in the dance.

On the AA, ’Love (Version)’ cranks martial drums for propulsion; a euphoric rhythm searching for a vocal. Aye it’s a special one.

Some heat coming in this series, keep it locked.

              (Horn Of Plenty)",Horn Of Plenty,"Dirt-caked, tape-damaged outsider jams at their filthiest, Germ Lattice's debut is a flagrant deconstruction of post-punk, unravelling screwed basslines, chants and ritualistic beats with time dilating, on-the-fly concrète processes and canny studio techniques. Properly advanced biz, bit like hearing Valerio Tricoli let loose on The Fall's master tapes.

Friends for years when they were knocking around in London, it wasn't until Joe Barton, Mickey Donnelly and Louie Rice moved to Norwich and... more",/products/gipping-through-the-ages,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/964838/product/HOP32.jpg,2633,Demdike Stare,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2633

Coming off like the Persian offspring of The Slits, ESG, or Liquid Liquid, the ‘Tambal EP’ extends a welcome introduction to Nushin Naini and Nicolini Mauskovic’s limber duo, Devon Rexi. Arriving with minimal fanfare but packing bags of groove per ounce, they properly nail a classic turn-of-‘80s sound patently nodding to movements in the UK... more",/products/tambal-ep,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/806891/product/SON12002.jpg,2633,Demdike Stare,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2633
