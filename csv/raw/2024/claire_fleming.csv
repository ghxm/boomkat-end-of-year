""It's not Cocteau Twins, and it's not me,"" Budd said in a 1986 interview, ""it's an odd combination peculiar to the mixture.""

It's revelatory stuff, quite different from the usual Sunday changes, with unusual, sonorous note clusters and dizzying repetitions.  

Like many Brits, Bryars grew up hearing church bells, and the sounds imprinted themselves on his consciousness.
