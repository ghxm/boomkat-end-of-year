              (Bison Records)",Bison Records,"Genuinely smart art school rock is hard to come by, but Still House Plants make it sound easy, welding subtly R&B-inflected vocals to fractured, free jazz-cum-post rock drums and Shellac-strength axe acrobatics on their incredible third album. Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over. Tortoise were making firmer connections with Chicago's... more",/products/if-i-don-t-make-it-i-love-u,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925177/product/5056688817176_T12_Image.jpg,2629,John Chantler,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2629

It finds the duo stripped to a quietly cathartic, windswept arrangement of bare vocals rent with spectral webs of synth and countrified guitar in a wholly inimitable style that’s enveloped and crushed our spirit like nothing else we heard all year. It does that thing so few albums do of feeling entirely familiar, cut from classic material, but skewed just off centre in a way that makes it hit entirely differently.  If yr into anything... more",/products/rhinestones-dd7ccab9-33de-4688-b683-c52577904092,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/756840/product/Cover.jpg,2629,John Chantler,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2629

Aussie sound artist and sculptor Lamb is best known for his use of Aeolian harps - gigantic string instruments that are played by the wind itself.
