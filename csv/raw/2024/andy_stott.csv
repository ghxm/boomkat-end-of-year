Short, sharp and so, so sweet - a taste of things to come.

It's a sign of creative maturity and marks a welcome move away from the Fennesz-style layered glitchscapes that have dominated his back-catalogue. It's hard to tell exactly how these drone tapestries are woven together; the granular laptop trickery of old is virtually undetectable and the source instruments detuned and dissolved to the point of blissful obscurity.
