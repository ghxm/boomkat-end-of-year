              Here in the Pitch
            
              (City Slang)",City Slang,"Jessica Pratt fleshes out the bare-boned folk of her previous records on 'Here in the Pitch', sculpting dimly lit Californian memories into tape-saturated, pseudo-hauntological vignettes and sounding almost like Broadcast if they'd been brought up on a diet of The Beach Boys, The Walker Brothers, Burt Bacharach and Van Dyke Parks. Utterly brilliant stuff - Pratt's most satisfying album yet.

Pratt's always been good, but 'Here in the Pitch' is an unexpected and perfectly realised left turn... more",/products/here-in-the-pitch,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/949348/product/4250506849290.jpg,2593,Sarah Davachi,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2593

An established visual artist and pianist, Balon cracks open his sonic universe on this one, clustering seemingly disparate ideas and elements into a cryptic, intimate narrative.

Johnson's music took a sharp turn in 2022 when she released the plangent 'Sonescent', that was conceived after a stay at a silent meditation center in Southern California. The nervous, warped pop that undergirded her early material was replaced with... more",/products/stena,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/946589/product/781484092353.jpg,2593,Sarah Davachi,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2593

              (RVNG Intl.)",RVNG Intl.,"Tashi Wada's first new album in over five years is also his most surprising, comprising a set of elevated, poetic songs that draw from psych-rock, new age and ambient, leaving the tonally rich, avant-minimal drone he's most widely associated with to simmer in the background. It's gorgeous, subtly extravagant ""Dream Music"" - one for fans of Julia Holter (who appears here on vocal duties), Jim O'Rourke, Rafael Toral, Joanna Brouk, Terry Riley.

We don't know exactly what kind of music might have been performed on the aulos, but it's depicted all over ancient Greek art. A double-reeded flute that's related to the Armenian duduk and the Albanian longari, the instrument is shrouded in mystery: we know... more",/products/the-telescopic-aulos-of-atlas,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/940528/product/647581408070.jpg,2593,Sarah Davachi,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2593

Always more to Holter's albums than immediately meets the eye, immersive, repeated listens recommended.
