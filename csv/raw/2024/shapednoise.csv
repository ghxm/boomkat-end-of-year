On ‘The Healer’ Sumac reprise their role at metal’s vanguard with expansive arrangements of Turner’s signature, claw-handled guitars and hoarse croak, Brian Cook’s abyssal bass guitar, and Nick Yacyshyn’s guillotine drums, all prone to leave it all hanging in the... more",/products/the-healer-bb28d79d-f4c6-4d21-9d53-1dba69724893,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/931410/product/790377060966_T5_Image.jpg,2740,Shapednoise,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2740

We've heard plenty of different music from KMRU over the last few years, but until now, his voice is an element he's left relatively unexplored.
