              (W.25TH)",W.25TH,"Bursting at the seams with ideas and mushy emotionality, Cindy Lee's hypnagogic 2-hour magnum opus has quite rightly been touted as one of the best albums of the year - if not the decade. Ex-Women frontperson Patrick Flegel's vision of rock 'n roll is anachronistically nostalgic, an oily tincture of vintage psych, dilated funk and ghosted girl group pop that stews in its heartbreaking sincerity. Urgent listening for fans of Jessica Pratt, Brian Wilson, The Walker Brothers, U.S. Girls or Karen... more",/products/diamond-jubilee-4ded0054-8acb-4340-b091-4fbcd3f633e1,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/963386/product/W25-18_web_1024x1024.jpg,2611,Elaine Howley,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2611

              (City Slang)",City Slang,"Jessica Pratt fleshes out the bare-boned folk of her previous records on 'Here in the Pitch', sculpting dimly lit Californian memories into tape-saturated, pseudo-hauntological vignettes and sounding almost like Broadcast if they'd been brought up on a diet of The Beach Boys, The Walker Brothers, Burt Bacharach and Van Dyke Parks. Utterly brilliant stuff - Pratt's most satisfying album yet.

Pratt's always been good, but 'Here in the Pitch' is an unexpected and perfectly realised left turn... more",/products/here-in-the-pitch,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/949348/product/4250506849290.jpg,2611,Elaine Howley,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2611

Landing somewhere between Neil Young and Pavement, it's modern American folk-pop that's bursting with feeling.

'Manning Fireworks' is Lenderman's most lavish record yet; his country-indie stomp has been tamed a little here, with fiddles and twangy acoustic bass sounds peeking between the lap steel whines and pensive acoustic... more",/products/manning-fireworks,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/955749/product/a1888800323_10.jpg,2611,Elaine Howley,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2611

In just five short years, Fratti has worked at an alarming pace, constantly tweaking her sound over four surprising, and unusually approachable full-lengths.
