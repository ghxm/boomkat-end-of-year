              (Warp Records)",Warp Records,"On their 2006 follow-up to 'Geogaddi', Boards Of Canada indulged their tastes for a folk-rock and shoegaze sound that had long lain latent, shimmering around their beats.

We're not so keen on the opener 'Dayvan Cowboy', but there's some archetypal BoC gear to be heard on the lovely 'Left Side Drive' and the rolling blend of breaks and library synth shivers in 'Sklyliner', besides the two gorgeous interludes, 'Heard From Telegraph Lines' and 'Under The Coke Sign'.

Having made her debut with her father, Serge, in 1986 (Charlotte For Ever aka Lemon Incest) Gainsbourg left it some twenty years before getting back to recording music, and came up... more",/products/irm-8298fc3c-d32e-4397-9ebb-7658907ca5e1,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/971427/product/charlottegainsborough-irm.jpg,2603,Malibu,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2603

Laurel Halo's long-in-the-making debut album for her newly minted Awe label is dazzling; a mix of weightless jazz, orchestral and drift energies that’s both elusive and engrossing; just when you think you have the measure of it, it shapeshifts into something else.
