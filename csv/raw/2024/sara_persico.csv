              (Late Music)",Late Music,"Sarah Davachi surpasses herself on this one, following the brilliant 'Antiphonals' and 'Two Sisters' with a decisive suite of mind-bending psychoacoustic chamber-prog dilations that effortlessly reconcile her last decade of relentless R&D. There's plenty of organ music around at the minute, but 'The Head...' undoubtedly sets a new high: sonorous, cryptic, endlessly inquisitive music that pulses with mystery and supernatural awe.

The most unsettlingly brilliant music we've heard yet from Brazil, Anderson do Paraiso's 'Queridão' strips favela funk down to its barest bones, interspersing raps and... more",/products/queridao,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/918259/product/768558901414.jpg,2738,Sara Persico,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2738

Seriously elevated gear, essential listening for anyone into Christina Kubisch, Fennesz or Kassel Jaeger.

When he was working on 'Natur' back in 2022, KMRU found himself hung up on the difference in noise between Berlin where he now lives, and Nairobi... more",/products/natur-c5a20c23-96ae-46be-abdb-ecca196e8bc2,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/935802/product/5050580819405.jpg,2738,Sara Persico,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2738

Swinging silken tarraxo syncopations around wavey synths and breathy vocals to forward a unique vision of cosmic, syruppy soul/R&B, it’s a properly heady album of late night batida heaters from what is, still, one of the world’s most forward facing labels.

Grotesque and, at times, strangely beautiful, 'O.O.Orifice' is a neat advancement of some of the musical ideas Sharafi laid out on her compelling last full-length, 2021's improv-heavy 'KARIZ'.

Luminous and frenzied, it's his sleaziest, noisiest and most satisfying full-length yet.

Wandinger came up with this one purely out of necessity.
