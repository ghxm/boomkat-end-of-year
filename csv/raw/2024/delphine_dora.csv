              (Horn Of Plenty)",Horn Of Plenty,"Almost a quarter of a century into her thing, Belgian DIY folk outlier Annelies Monseré returns with her most satisfying and fully realised album yet, a tantalising spiral of folk x early music vapours, inhabiting a realm shared with Trish Keenan's recently released Broadcast demos, and Nico's influential Desertshore. 

Recorded in much the same way as its excellent predecessor 'Mares', with close mic'd vocals that magnify Monseré's restrained emotions, 'I sigh, I resign' shifts into its own dimension... more",/products/i-sigh-i-resign,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/939593/product/HOP25.jpg,2580,Delphine Dora,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2580

              (A Colourful Storm)",A Colourful Storm,"A Colourful Storm unearth this killer 2009 album from beloved Japanese acid folk band Eddie Marcon, bringing it to vinyl for the first time. It's softly-spoken, delicate and frayed at the edges - completely essential listening if ur into Ai Aso, Tenniscoats or Maher Shalal Hash Baz.

We first came across Eddie Marcon way back in '05, when the band welded together two of their earliest CDRs into the (pre Longform Editions) Preservation-released 'Shining on Graveposts'. It took us completely by surprise... more",/products/yahho-no-potori,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/933964/product/4251804191142_2500.jpg,2580,Delphine Dora,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2580

Not just a selection of demos like 'Distant Call', this one's a fuzzy image of what the finished album might have been, with psychedelic synth experiments, organ jams, hymnals and tape-mangled poems interrupting Keenan and James Cargill's unmistakable reverb-drenched arrangements.

Utterly brilliant stuff - Pratt's most satisfying album yet.

Pratt's always been good, but 'Here in the Pitch' is an unexpected and perfectly realised left turn... more",/products/here-in-the-pitch,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/949348/product/4250506849290.jpg,2580,Delphine Dora,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2580
