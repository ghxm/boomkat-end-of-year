At their best, Saint Etienne captured the zeitgeist, stewing electropop and nascent club sounds on 'Foxbase Alpha' back in 1991, dub and indie dancefloor-ready house on 'So Tough', and even... more",/products/the-night-0de463c6-fd98-4ada-9da1-a93cf01c46eb,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/970736/product/5400863176372.jpg,2618,Moopie,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2618

Piano has featured on previous offerings from Atkinson, but the instrument has never been quite so central to the music as it is on 'Space as an Instrument'.
