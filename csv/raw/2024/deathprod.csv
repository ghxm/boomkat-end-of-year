              (SusannaSonata)",SusannaSonata,"Working with found sounds, instruments and her own voice, Stina Stjern makes a striking noise on 'Vivid Peace Restored', damaging her sounds with tape hiss and saturation to create a surreal audio diary that's right at home on Susanna Wallumrød's SusannaSonata imprint.

For over two decades, Stjern has been a Norwegian mainstay, fronting rock band Supervixen when she was still a teenager, and blurring shoegaze and psychedelia on her last two solo albums.
