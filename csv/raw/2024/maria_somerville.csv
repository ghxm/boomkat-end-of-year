Like its predecessor, 'Airs' is a demonstration of Dublin-based Keane's virtuosic sound design skills, but it's not showy.

Using his arsenal of hand-made synths to sing like birds around stretched, steel-wound drones, he evokes Bach, Loren Connors, Gavin Bryars and Rhys Chatham on a longform piece full of conventional chord progressions and... more",/products/spectral-evolution,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/939368/product/781484901426.jpg,2748,Maria Somerville,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2748

Wood was struck by the sheer number of empty churches that surrounded her when she moved to Ireland, so she took matters into her own hands and decided to use the vast, reverberant space to anchor 'Piano Reverb'. She hauled her antique Blüthner grand piano into a vacant church hall, and while she spent a year... more",/products/piano-reverb,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/920956/product/4062548083163_T9_Image.jpg,2748,Maria Somerville,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2748

Even though 'Rocky Top Ballads' is Fine's first fully fleshed-out solo offering, she operates from the center of Denmark's fertile alt-pop scene.
