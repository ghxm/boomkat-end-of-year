The soundtrack to a 1994 audiobook version of William Gibson’s cyberspace prophecy, ’Neuromancer’ is finally unveiled on the novel’s 40th anniversary after parts of it were previously manifested on Blackest Ever... more",/products/neuromancer-6710cc03-9d44-4e3c-9426-db2dee4648f8,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/957642/product/RM4237_Cover.jpg,2736,Jake Muir,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2736

Expansive and hard to categorise, it's a precision-tooled set of ice-cold tonal productions that heavily lean into Mika Vainio’s rhythm experiments, with extra levels of growling bass and curious noises to send us deep into the... more",/products/provoke-fdd218a0-a736-48f2-baf6-15ff4fda37bd,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/961012/product/cover.jpg,2736,Jake Muir,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2736

The man-machine duo reprise inimitably uncanny energies blending reactive live improvisations with subtle post-edit stitching that mess with the grid as they appear to move amorphous objects in abstracted space-time.

Utterly brilliant stuff - Pratt's most satisfying album yet.

On ‘Trepidation Cycles’ Pent trades in a style of shearing sound design and displaced rhythmic syntax primed for listeners who like it abstract but just about yoked back from all out oddness.
