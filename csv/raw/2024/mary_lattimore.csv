For decades at this point, Parker has been restlessly innovating both as a soloist and a keen collaborator, working with formative post-rock outfits like Isotope 217... more",/products/the-way-out-of-easy,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/969177/product/789993995028_T5_Image.jpg,2601,Mary Lattimore,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2601
