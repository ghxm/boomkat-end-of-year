Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over.

'Pretty Penny Slur' is the duo's battered take on punk: it's loose-limbed, snotty and rough-edged, but assembled from ritualistic coiled riffs and tilted, basement-strength beats. Next level biz as expected - one for fans of Moin, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Loop or the Melvins.

It's like Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira' or Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' rebuilt painstakingly by an AI-powered server farm, the edges hand-frayed into surreal, fractal patterns. A late-year contender for pop album of the year, no doubt.
