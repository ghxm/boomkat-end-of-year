Highly active since 2010, when footwork really put a vital toe in dance music’s behind, DJ Manny can be hailed a pioneer and bastion of its 2nd wave, keenly regarded for his deftest style of feet-off-the-ground aerosoul. ‘Hypnotised’ is the perfect summation of his sound in 2023, where the ghosts of classic chicago club music -... more",/products/hypnotized-41d42c99-7e62-4ca4-b50e-a88cf25f77c7,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/892695/product/5056321682604_T13_Image.jpg,2728,sideproject,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2728

Following 2021's boundary-pushing 'Club Apathy' wasn't going to be easy, but Osheyack and Nahash chase the same dragon, providing a cache of cybernetic, cross-pollinated club evolutions that look past the contemporary landscape's obsession with... more",/products/bait-ce8f5b09-c81f-4093-bc20-a91921289dd7,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/928913/product/5056688826857_T7_Image.jpg,2728,sideproject,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2728
