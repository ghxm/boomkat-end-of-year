Born in Paris in 1934, Nicole Lachartre took an internship with Pierre Schaeffer at the GRM in 1967 and is rumoured to have assisted Pierre Henry on his 1968 piece 'L'Apocalypse... more",/products/mundus-d6d33119-a5fd-4d5d-a69c-213ffbc89f92,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/876575/product/Metaphon012_Cover.jpg,2706,crys cole,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2706
