              (Motion Ward)",Motion Ward,"Fizzing thru the aether like a half-remembered dream, Ulla and Ultrafog's collaborative debut is a surreal shimmer of imploded shoegaze-y guitar riffs, thick subs and lassoed vocals. Like an especially dissociated strain of hypnagogic pop, its sequence of trace recollections netted into a syrup of entrancing and half-speed ambience comes highly recommended if you’ve enjoyed work by Perila, Romance, Vincent Gallo, claire rousay or Oval.

The lightbulb moment came for Pentu when their laptop broke down at a gig and he was forced to reconsider his setup.
