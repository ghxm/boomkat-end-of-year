Swinging silken tarraxo syncopations around wavey synths and breathy vocals to forward a unique vision of cosmic, syruppy soul/R&B, it’s a properly heady album of late night batida heaters from what is, still, one of the world’s most forward facing labels.

It's achingly beautiful, soaked with Northern rain and fuzzy, after-hours memories - the mid-point between 6LACK, Unknown T, Slug Christ, Yungwebster and Space Afrika we never knew we needed.
