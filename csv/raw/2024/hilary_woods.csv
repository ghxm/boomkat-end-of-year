              (Sun Royalle)",Sun Royalle,"After quietly releasing one of the definitive debut albums of the 2020’s so far with ‘Glass Lit Dream’, Ian Mugerwa aka Dawuna returns with a further re-imagining of R&B that nods to Prince's genius Black-album era productions, and especially his high-pitched Camille alter ego, as well as Jai Paul’s effortlessly scrappy pop perfection - and so much more beside that, linking emotional contradictions and troubled narratives with production and vox that feel primal in their emotional register.

              (World Of Echo)",World Of Echo,"Dead strong etheric elisions of chamber-jazz, trip hop and dream-pop from Bristol’s Tara Clerkin Trio, following up their acclaimed self-titled debut with a new EP of subdued but glowing reveries somewhere between Dominique Lawalrée's intimate parlour music, Third Eye Foundation's atmospheric configurations and the sort of skewed pop we'll always associate with the Laika x Moonshake axis. 

The effortless drift of ’In Spring’ is the trio’s 2nd vinyl release after 2019’s eponymous debut... more",/products/in-spring-04aebaac-da58-4062-bf08-52fe4cb41a37,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/756365/product/5056321653192_T5_Image.jpg,2623,Hilary Woods,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2623

Expansive and hard to categorise, it's a precision-tooled set of ice-cold tonal productions that heavily lean into Mika Vainio’s rhythm experiments, with extra levels of growling bass and curious noises to send us deep into the... more",/products/provoke-fdd218a0-a736-48f2-baf6-15ff4fda37bd,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/961012/product/cover.jpg,2623,Hilary Woods,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2623
