              (Touch)",Touch,"Billed as Christian Fennesz's most reflective album, 'Mosaic' is a mature, concentrated set of textured guitar granulisations that plays like a sequel to 'Venice', with the Austrian artist's deconstructionist sense of pop melodicism underpinning even his most abstract experiments.

'Mosaic' got its title from Fennesz's labour intensive production approach, where he would build each element separately, slowly assembling a full, vivid soundscape piece-by-piece. It's the first he's written... more",/products/mosaic-f4eacb4a-d0a0-4a4e-b22a-4fd081d475c8,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/961902/product/5050580830158.jpg,2711,Thaddeus Herrmann,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2711

""The Declining Winter’s Last April is not a heart-on-your-sleeve record. It does away with the sleeve and goes straight for carving a heart on the arm.

Ronald Lippok and Bernd Jestram have been making music together for decades - they were in a punk band together before they even formed Tarwater in the mid '90s.

Ten albums in and Robert Henke's still in his own lane, even after inspiring countless copyists. So it's high time for the producer to inventory his process, which he deconstructs in great detail on 'Studio'.
