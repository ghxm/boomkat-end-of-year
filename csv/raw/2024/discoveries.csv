Simultaneously holding down a day job as an illustrator, Kurachi's been building his reputation on the Japanese underground circuit for decades at this stage, carving out a name for himself as one of the... more",/products/open-today,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/963425/product/5056688837815_T11_Image.jpg,2690,Discoveries,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2690
