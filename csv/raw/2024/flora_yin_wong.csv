'The Island of Bouncy Memories' is Vitiello's attempt to map his dreamworld, based on initial sketches he made using his collection of childhood toys.

‘Kiosque Versions’ has nowt to do with Tolouse Low Trax’s ‘Kiosque of Arrows’ compilation of other artists, but does take its cues from a wealth of offbeat solo works conjured by the erstwhile Salon des Amateurs and current Parisian resident.
