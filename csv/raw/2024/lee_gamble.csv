Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over. Tortoise were making firmer connections with Chicago's... more",/products/if-i-don-t-make-it-i-love-u,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925177/product/5056688817176_T12_Image.jpg,2643,Lee Gamble,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2643

'Mosaic' got its title from Fennesz's labour intensive production approach, where he would build each element separately, slowly assembling a full, vivid soundscape piece-by-piece.
