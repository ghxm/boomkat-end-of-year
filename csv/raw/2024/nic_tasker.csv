              (Hyperdub)",Hyperdub,"Arriving on Hyperdub for their first proper solo release in ages, Mica Levi delivers a 17 minute (12 on the digitals) orchestral dream pop epic, dispersing hallucinatory vocals buried in silvery clouds of strings and a motorik rhythm, somewhere in the vicinity of work by Dean Blunt and A.R. Kane, but ultimately just Mica’s thing.

There's a fantastical quality to Levi's music that's present even in their most stripped-to-the-bone productions, from 2017's DDS-released classic 'Delete Beach' to 2020's... more",/products/slob-air,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/945660/product/5056321681843_T2_Image.jpg,2631,Nic Tasker,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2631

              (W.25TH)",W.25TH,"Bursting at the seams with ideas and mushy emotionality, Cindy Lee's hypnagogic 2-hour magnum opus has quite rightly been touted as one of the best albums of the year - if not the decade. Ex-Women frontperson Patrick Flegel's vision of rock 'n roll is anachronistically nostalgic, an oily tincture of vintage psych, dilated funk and ghosted girl group pop that stews in its heartbreaking sincerity.

              (Bison Records)",Bison Records,"Genuinely smart art school rock is hard to come by, but Still House Plants make it sound easy, welding subtly R&B-inflected vocals to fractured, free jazz-cum-post rock drums and Shellac-strength axe acrobatics on their incredible third album. Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over. Tortoise were making firmer connections with Chicago's... more",/products/if-i-don-t-make-it-i-love-u,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925177/product/5056688817176_T12_Image.jpg,2631,Nic Tasker,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2631

If you've caught any of Alpha Maid's previous releases, or last year's fudgy, hook-laden 'spresso' EP, then you'll already know the kind of floury interference to expect. This one's rounder and more considered than its predecessor, starting with the... more",/products/fast-set-cement,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/922207/product/0840200585866.jpg,2631,Nic Tasker,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2631

In just five short years, Fratti has worked at an alarming pace, constantly tweaking her sound over four surprising, and unusually approachable full-lengths.

'Mosaic' got its title from Fennesz's labour intensive production approach, where he would build each element separately, slowly assembling a full, vivid soundscape piece-by-piece.
