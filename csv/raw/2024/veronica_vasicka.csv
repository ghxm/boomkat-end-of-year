Best known for her tenure in Thus Owls, The Moth and Josef & Erika, Angell goes it alone on this 'un, twisting her voice around a backdrop of terse, moody electronics and fractured, freeform jazz.

Where a lesser presence could have let that production dominate, Gordon is always the total focus of our attention, the rhythm - as sick as it is - functions almost like a stock backing track, such is her shine. Essential gear.

For what feels like a lifetime, British Murder Boys have been at the bleeding edge of techno, both with their solo works during the ‘90s, and since their fortuitous fusion on 2003’s ‘Learn Your Lesson’ and ‘Don’t Give Way to Fear’ set the course for early ‘00s industrial techno... more",/products/active-agents-and-house-boys,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/931451/product/8718723253871.jpg,2607,Veronica Vasicka,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2607
