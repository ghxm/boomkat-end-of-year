              (Bison Records)",Bison Records,"Genuinely smart art school rock is hard to come by, but Still House Plants make it sound easy, welding subtly R&B-inflected vocals to fractured, free jazz-cum-post rock drums and Shellac-strength axe acrobatics on their incredible third album. Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over. Tortoise were making firmer connections with Chicago's... more",/products/if-i-don-t-make-it-i-love-u,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925177/product/5056688817176_T12_Image.jpg,2692,Nigel Yang,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2692

Using his arsenal of hand-made synths to sing like birds around stretched, steel-wound drones, he evokes Bach, Loren Connors, Gavin Bryars and Rhys Chatham on a longform piece full of conventional chord progressions and... more",/products/spectral-evolution,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/939368/product/781484901426.jpg,2692,Nigel Yang,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2692
