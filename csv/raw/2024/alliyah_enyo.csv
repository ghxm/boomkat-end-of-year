Trust, it’s special stuff.

Kristin Reiman, aka Man Rei, elevates and expands the choral tradition of their Baltic homeland with the smudged drift of this quietly epic new album.

An afters gem, it mutates vaporous dub techno into undulating, glutinous ambience - one for fans of West Mineral, Jan Jelinek, 3XL and early Space Afrika, for sure.
