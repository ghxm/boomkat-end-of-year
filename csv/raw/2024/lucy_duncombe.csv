              (Hundebiss)",Hundebiss,"Ramallah's Muqata'a continues his flawless run with another disorienting blast of chaotic chopped breaks and lurching neo-beat tape MPC programming. Imagine Ras G collaborating with the SVBKBLT roster using samples from Middle Eastern radio transmissions: pure headmelters.

'Kamil Manqus' is the fifth full-length from Ramallah rhythm conductor Muqata'a, furthering his deep dive into the beat scene's outer realms as he yokes loose, free-flowing rap-tempo beats with noisy abstraction... more",/products/kamil-manqus-060b7f5d-b246-4214-a464-6bb9ebe55148,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/718008/product/5056321646989_T9_Image.jpg,2610,Lucy Duncombe,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2610

On 'Modern Sorrow' he tenders his answer to contemporary R&B and radio rap, contorting his voice with AutoTune and shepherding whirring bossa and caliginous samples.
