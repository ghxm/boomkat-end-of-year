Pajo only recorded one Aerial M Peel Session, dragging his tour-torn bandmates into the BBC Radio One studios in Spring of '98 to dub lush alternative versions of 'Skrag Theme', 'Vivea' and 'Safeless'. The tracks all featured on his early run - 'Skrag Theme was from his '97-released self-titled Aerial M debut, 'Safeless' from '98's... more",/products/the-peel-sessions,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/945704/product/781484091226.jpg,2588,Max D,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2588

‘Seven hundred and fifty loops’ mints SnPLO co-op label Pin with a brace of drum loops swept up in heady filter chicanery and FX.

Coming in from the wilderness to deliver his first record since 2017, stepping off the path he’s been trodding through lovers rock to explore new territories of rhythm, sound and sub bass pressure.""

For decades at this point, Parker has been restlessly innovating both as a soloist and a keen collaborator, working with formative post-rock outfits like Isotope 217... more",/products/the-way-out-of-easy,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/969177/product/789993995028_T5_Image.jpg,2588,Max D,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2588

Genius, just a bit.

There was a moment during post-rock's evolution when it felt as if the jazz influence that had been simmering in the background since the Talk Talk days was about to bubble over. Tortoise were making firmer connections with Chicago's... more",/products/if-i-don-t-make-it-i-love-u,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/925177/product/5056688817176_T12_Image.jpg,2588,Max D,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2588

Trust Deal to give us the ultimate fake-out while introducing a solo full-length we've been waiting on for decades. The first single, 'Coast', is the album's most mischievous, a wobbly wedding band flashback that seems to interpolate Blondie as Deal casts her mind... more",/products/nobody-loves-you-more,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/968390/product/191400073357_T12_Image.jpg,2588,Max D,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2588
