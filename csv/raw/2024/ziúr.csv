              (Sun Royalle)",Sun Royalle,"After quietly releasing one of the definitive debut albums of the 2020’s so far with ‘Glass Lit Dream’, Ian Mugerwa aka Dawuna returns with a further re-imagining of R&B that nods to Prince's genius Black-album era productions, and especially his high-pitched Camille alter ego, as well as Jai Paul’s effortlessly scrappy pop perfection - and so much more beside that, linking emotional contradictions and troubled narratives with production and vox that feel primal in their emotional register.

              (Accidental Meetings)",Accidental Meetings,"Cairo's Dijit has always been good, but on 'Wisswass' he augments his shadowed trip-hop reconstructions with his own words for the first time, delivering a hoarse, Tricky-like snarl. Featuring levitational collaborations with Lella and Sarah Shedid, it's a must-hear for anyone who's as hooked on 'Pre-Millennium Tension' and 'Like Weather' as we are - or even fans of latter-day outsiders like Coby Sey or Tirzah.

On his last couple of records for Manchester's YOUTH, Hashem L Kelesh, better... more",/products/wisswass,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/935600/product/8718723256452.jpg,2742,Ziúr,2024,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2024/2742

Featuring guest appearances from Coby Sey, MICHAELBRAILEY and Abdullah Miniawy, 'Lambda' is crucial listening if you're into Lee Gamble, Aïsha Devi, Piotr Kurek or Ziúr.
