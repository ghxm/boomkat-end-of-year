Roughly once a decade since 2000 the pioneering Afrofuturist has offered a new landmark of deep, electronic music, and ‘From the Far Future, Pt. 3’ stakes one of 2020’s - and probably the next... more",/products/from-the-far-future-pt-3,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/703047/product/5051142076649.jpg,1383,Mat Steel,2020,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2020/1383

Practically pocket-sized in comparison to their sprawling torrent of live material and radio recordings in recent years, ’Sign’ is a return to the sort of concision found circa ‘Exai’ and their earlier albums... more",/products/sign-d504e2f3-5ec4-456a-af9e-b037a7c82c64,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/698008/product/0801061032937.jpg,1383,Mat Steel,2020,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2020/1383

Judging by ‘Wuddaji’ it sounds like Theo has spent his time away slipping ever deeper into his own sound.
