              (Ghostly International)",Ghostly International,"Nobody does timeless yet modern ennui quite like HTRK. On their 4th album proper the duo trustingly cup your heart in a cats cradle of crepuscular rhythms & valium blues, all riddled with Jonnine Standish's ear worming mantras and Nigel Yang’s heat haze guitar shimmers.

Issued five years on from their excellent last album ‘Psychic 9-5 Club’, this new... more",/products/venus-in-leo,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/609578/product/804297834207_T57339745080054.jpg,1099,Serpente,2019,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2019/1099

For us, the real draw here is Prince's own version of ‘Make Up’ - but there are pearls aplenty throughout.

Straight to the good stuff; Vanity 6’s ‘Sex Shooter’ and ‘Make Up’ - the former a classically... more",/products/originals-91d0c804-c9fd-487c-970f-1a6c37a89eab,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/584312/product/Prince-Originals-1556199148-640x640.jpg,1099,Serpente,2019,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2019/1099
