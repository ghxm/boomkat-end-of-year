Unavoidably comparable to Autechre’s nervy tics and the asymmetric ructions of Dalglish, ‘Index Hole’ spurts brittle, overpronating bones and knotted tendons at every angle, rolling out form the hyperstep of ‘Arc Rail’ to crooked hip hop-tyle rhythmic... more",/products/index-hole,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/580940/product/5050580708464.jpg,1076,Calum Gunn,2019,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2019/1076

Packing as much into each fractious bar as possible, W00dy treads the finest line between chaos and control in a breathless volley of pointillist stutter and rhythmic attack that recalls early Venetian... more",/products/my-diary-e685f0ba-7f79-4d23-b724-21e283bd5a66,https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/608976/product/MYDIARY.jpg,1076,Calum Gunn,2019,https://boomkat.com/charts/boomkat-end-of-year-charts-2019/1076

One of the UK’s unique dancefloor experimenters since his tempo shifting debut for Nightslugs in 2010, Mosca really pushes the envelope of his sound in mad ways with ‘Touchie Riddim’, seemingly spinning the dance in a haywire gyroscope to the nuttiest ends.

‘Fucking Sick Of Myself Since Day One (Hot Desk Mix)’ starts out promising with a brooding payload of darkside rave pressure, but quickly gets a bit dodgy with splashing big beat breaks that take us right back to early ‘00s raves we’d rather forget.
